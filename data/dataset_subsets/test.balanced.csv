 Hi 
   I think Dingle ,he was right in questioning Ensteins special relativity of uniform motion and time.My question is the same as Dingles.Einstein said,that the time of the moving observer will slow from the point of view of the resting observer. 
 If I consider ,the moving observer at rest then the previously resting observer will be in motion,so his time will slow.(Ignoring acceleration of course).Can both observers be right?Dingles answer is that they cannot becouse this would invalidate the theory of time dilation. I tried to find a simple answer  on the internet in defence of Einstein, but without any success.Its strange,becouse this is such an obvious question that it should have been answered clearly by now.

 == Like to be mop-nominated? == 

 Your name has been on, and indeed near the top of WP:NA for quite a while, but so far as I know you've never been nominated.  Your contributions look industrious and uncontroversial, and I can see no reason why you shouldn't get the mop, if you're indeed interested.  Would you like me to nominate you?    

 :I'm saying nothing about rising times of a Sunday morning, on the """"glass houses"""" principle.  Nominated, you now need to accept, answer the questions, and list the page.  Indeed, pretty much no way to tell, but I can see no reason you wouldn't be accepted.  Look at it this way:  if there's some mysterious objection people would have, better to discover it now, make whatever amends or corrective action might be required, and get re-nominated in due course, if the worst comes to the worst.    

 ::As I alluded to above, technically you're supposed to do that bit yourself....    

 :::Maybe it's a final initiative/technical skills test? )  Best of luck!    

 I see a distinct pattern in the opposes/concerned-sounding neutrals!  Regardless of which way this pans out (and it's fairly finely poised at present), can I suggest you consider joining a wikiproject as a """"kinder, gentler"""" means of having more interactions with other users, and the project space?  And/or one of the more neglected """"process"""" pages  categories for deletion/renaming, or requested moves, if you're interested in naming convention matters, stub proposals/deletions, etc, etc.  Not so painful as AFD, or as full-bore wikipolitics, I promise.    

 :The neutrals are basically not counted, unless the support:oppose ratio is really in the """"grey area"""".  (Notice that Ian13 was just promoted with barely 75% support, not counting the neutrals at all.)  I don't suggest you take part in a WPJ or process page only to get your namespace edit count up, and I certainly don't suggest one you have no actual interest in:  as I say, I think it would be worth considering regardless of the RfA outcome.  But I'd think you'd have some interest in Wikipedia:WikiProject Football, Wikipedia:Typo and similar """"cleanup"""" activities...  And WP:WSS could always do with more slave^Wvolunteer labour, I can testify from personal experience.    

 ::You're very welcome.    

 :::Hope I'm not tempting fate by jumping the gun of the actual closure, but as the deadline's passed, and unless there are about six late-breaking opposes...  Well done, talk to people occasionally, but keep up the good work  and don't swing to the opposite end of the spectrum and turn into a total process-fiend, either!

تشکر کنم از ملت مصر که با اتحاد خودشان بالاخره تکليف کشورشونو مشخص کردن و کشور رو از بي سروسامان گيري در اوردن البته با خبر هستم که درگيريهايي در مصر ايجاد ميشه اما خب خوشبختانه ديگه مثل سابق نيست ولي خب همين درگيري ها هم مسلما به دلايلي هست که مي تونم مهم ترينش رو بي کفايتي مسئولين دولت مصر بدونم مثل همه دولت ها.اين سياست مسئولين دولت هاست که وقتي بر سر کار ميان مسئوليت پذيريشون فقط مال دو سه هفته اول هست از اون دفعه به بعد ميشه به مرور زمان شاهد هزاران تغييرات در انها بود اين تغييرات باعث ميشه شخصيت اونا تقيربا صد و هشتاد درجه عوض بشه و فردي رو به ما نشون بده که  با يک هويت جديد ممکنه بپرسيد مگه هويت ادما عوض ميشه من در جواب خواهم گفت در چنين شرايطي اره اما نه اينکه هويت و اصالتشون عوض بشه منظور من ويژگي هاي اصالتشون ادميتشون و هويتشون هست والله اونا پابرجاست ووقتي ادم ويژگي هاي اون رو از دست بده چه فرقي ميکنه با کسي که اونو نداره چنين اشخاص با چنين تغييرات شبيه به موجوداتي ميشن فقط و فقط با يک اصل زندگي ميکنند اين صفت به مرور زمان در مسئولين دولت ها ايجاد ميشه و اونم در نتيجه ستايش هاي مردم و انتظار مسئولي از مردم از چنين ستايش هايي هست من سر گذشت مصر رو تا حدي مي دونم چون نمونه ايش رو در کتاب سينوهه خوندم در زمان گذشته مصر مردم مصر در نتيجه اهميت و بها دادن به فراعنع مصر از اونا شخصيت هايي ساختن که اين شخصيت ها خودشونو خداي مردم اعلام کردن بنظرتون در اين تغيير شخصيت فقط مسئولين مقصرند؟مسلما نه بلکه مردمي که انها را به جاي اينکه حاميان خود بپندارن حاکمان خود دانستند انسان در هر مرحله از زندگي که باشه مثل کودکي ميمونه که شرايط محيط و ديگران مثل مادر و خواهر اون ميمونن که که متاثر از اونا هستن و اعمال اونا مسئولين کشور هم يک نوع اوم هستن مثل همه ماها فقط با اين تفاوت  که اونا در مقام مسئولين کشور هستن و دارندگان و اداره کنندگان کشور ما در حکم شهروند هستيم و زير نظر اين اداره کنندگي کشور تجربه اين رو ثابت کرده که انسانها در روابط اجتماعي مي تونن به تکامل برسن يا اينکه خودشونو به نابودي بکشند اين نابودي مثل نابودي مرگ ظاهري نيست بلکه نابودي انسانيت و وجدان و حقيقت جويي هست البته همچين تفاوت زيادي با مرگ ظاهري نميکنه چون در مرگ ظاهري ادما جسمشونو از دست ميدن اما در مرگ باطني انسان شبيه مرده متحرک ميشه که فقط جسمش زنده هست اما سه اصلش خاموشه اين خاموشيت به مرور زمان از انسان موجودي ميسازه که کمتر شباهت به انسان داره چين موجودي به مرور زمان لکه هاي صفت بد رو در روحش نقش بندي ميکنه و همين لکه ها در نتيجه تمديد اين خاموشي به مرور زمان بزرگ تر ميشه و با قابليت پاک شدن کمتر مثل لباسي که چند روز لکه ها روش بمونن و مدام به جاي اينکه کم رنگ تر بشن مدام بهش رنگ اضافه ميشه و روز به روز پر رنگ تر ميشه اين پررنگ شدن درواقع همون عادت کردن انسان و شيرين شدن اون صفت براي انسان هست حالا اين شسرين شدن مي تونه به شکل اجباري تحت تاثير شرايط باشه و يا در نتيجه يک لذت حاصل از غريزه انساني وقتي حالت اجباري باشه فرد به ناچار تحت تاثير شرايط سياسي و اجتماعي ناچار تن به صفات بد بده ناچاره فراموش کنه و پرده بپوشونه رو انسانيت و حقيقت جويي و وجدانش چنين خصلتي مسلمابه مرور زمان از فرد شخصيتي منفعت جو درست ميکنه که واسه خاطر منافع اش دست به هزاران اعمال غير انساني ميزنه و شخصيتي انتقاد ناپذير چه به شکل مستقيم مثل کاري که محدوديتي که دولت هاي خاورميانه و برخوردي که اونا يا مخالفانشون ميکنند با اينکه مخالفانشون از نژاد خودشون و در داخل کشور هستن و چه به شکل غير مستقيم که در کشور هاي اروپايي و امريکايي به چشم ميخوره اعضاي دولت مصر و رياست جمهوري مصر اگر در مصر در زمان گذشته فراعنه خودشان رو چون خداياني ميپنداشتن که بر مردم حکومت کنند اکنون نيز با گذشته مصر فرقي نکرده فقط در ظاهر هست اما اگر بخواييد واقعيت رو نگته کنيد متوجه خواهيد شد که روش سياستي الان سياستمداران در کل دنيا به جاي ابنکه حامي مردم باشن خودشان را حاکم مردم مي دونن و حالت بعدي که فرد با سرگرم شدن در پرده پوشي در انسانيت و وجدان و حقيقت جويي لذت ميبره چنين اشخاصي لذت بردنشان محدوده چون قوه وجدان انسان چيزي نيست که از بين بره به مرور زمان اين قوه در انسان فعال تر ميشه مخصوصا در زماني که عجل انسان فرا برسه ممکنه خيلي وقتا هم باشه که در زمان عجل باز به کار نيوفته که اون نشان بر همون پررنگ تر شدن لکه ها در روح انسان ها به مرور زمان هست هدف همه اين گفته ها چي بود ؟اين بود که بگم در دنياي امروز سياستمداران تغييراتشون مدافعيتشون کمک هاشون و همه و همه عملکردهاشون به جاي اينکه در معناي واقعي خودشون به کار برده بشه فقط در پوشش اونها به کار برده ميشه اين نه ميشه روراستي نه ميشه عملکرد مناسب نه ميشه انسانيت نه ميشه وجدان و نه ميشه حقيقت جويي بلکه ميشه سود جو و منفعت طلب و دلبسته به

a3891e1048dfa310,":::::The fact was that Japan invaded North korea during World War II. You may not think of much here, but the atrocities committed by japan gave korea a right to invade in 1948. Korea, like Poland, was the beating ground of two armies committing atrocities. Now, if you look at history from a wide perspective you get chain reactions hundreds of years later with rival enemy states. Here though, you get an abuse of power, for instance Japan invades NK, millions die...immediately after USA invades NK and millions die..AGAIN. NK has every right to avoid this propagandistic bullshit, its actually a healing nation like Russia once was during the cold war. On top of that, there is a big karmic problem on your hands because korea was invaded many times before by Japan even before imperialism. The Mongols for instance, invaded Japan and loss. Japan cant be beaten and in my eyes it wasnt, just occupied because it hasnt changed its culture by invasion, only its economy. Basically Korea is not afraid of Japan, and its war crimes far exceed NK's expectations of this imperialist war. If you count wwI this is a large karmic punishment mainly because of the Chinese Civil War. Its all based on the old phrase, an Eye for an Eye. Japan and South Korea are just using the failed Mongolian invasion as a consensus as opposed to recent events I bet. If a nuke war were to break out here, it could kill our planet, spiraling it into infinite. The Aliens helped the Japanese defeat the Mongols, but who knows what nuclear war or really invasion could bring. This is a fact though, Korea never invaded the South but occupied it with special intentions and in WWII Korea lost as much if not more civilians than Japan alone, as a neutral country (given the precipice by the reader that Communism doesnt exist on the opposing side and people elect or choose their own governments over time eg I myself find it confusing that China is a Republic as South Korea is called instead of Democratic)  I would improve the article by stating North Korea came to liberate the South from its oppressors in the North Korean War.  The civilians that died during wwII were being liberated by war or war mongers so I agree that skirmishes in the south lead to direct intentions by the North due to past events.

 Vianello, I am sorry to inform you that I have closed your RfA as unlikely to reach consensus: there was a 6:1 ratio against the request at the time of processing. However, don't be downhearted by this: I can assure you that your contributions are both highly welcome and valued—many editors have failed their first request for adminship, only to sail through later and become well-respected administrators. 

 You may wish to review the Guide to RfA before submitting future nominations, as well as well as here and here, both of which list the more highly-supported RfAs. Additionally, admin coaching is a useful aid for editors interested in becoming an administrator. If I can assist you at all, please do not hesitate to contact me. Kindest regards,   

 :I would like to say that your responses to the WP:SNOW closing of this RfA were a great example of why I believe you will make a fine admin sometime in the future. I don't do admin coaching, or mentoring, or any of that stuff (because I don't want to commit to something with consequences to other people if I develop some problem with it) but if there are any questions that occur to you on which you might wish to hear the opinion of one admin, then my  is at your disposal. In the meantime, go the places where admins go and work out why they do what they do, work in article space to get a feel for what the encyclopedia is really all about, visit the policy pages and see how they relate to what you are learning, and ask questions of anyone you think might be able to help you. Let me know when you think you might re-apply. Cheers.    

 == Clarification == 

 When I made mention of CSD in your RfA, I had noticed a few errors of requesting speedy. Too many incorrectly placed speedy tags can hurt a future RfA. My apologies for not expounding while it was open, as I was offline. The other admin related areas most people look for is contributing to WP:AN and WP:ANI (they should be on your watchlist). You'd be responding to other editors questions or problems there, much like WP:HD. WP:AIV was a good start, WP:UAA would be good as well. Getting into conversations and expressing opinions on WT:RfA. And I'd also recommend reading over the WP:ARL. I hope this helps out a bit, and don't let your recent RfA discourage you from editing the pedia, or working on becoming an admin. Best regards'' and happy editing from    

 == By way of response to all of the above == 

 All understandable, and thanks! I'm actually still glad I made a go of it. It may not have been the appropriate way to go about it, but this process has resulted in getting me a lot more info and insight, which I'll be putting to use.

 :This review is transcluded from Talk:The Cookery Book of Lady Clark of Tillypronie/GA1. The edit link for this section can be used to add comments to the review. 

 Reviewer:   ·   

  

 I'm on much more familiar ground with this article than with the last of your GANs I tangled with. I wrote much of the two WP articles on Elizabeth David and her books, so you can set me down as another foodie. I blew the dust off Mrs David's Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen, and can tell you, if you'd prefer to add a page reference instead of the link at ref 17, that ED's mention of Lady Clark's Thick Parmesan Biscuits is on pp. 230–31 of my copy (the Grub Street 2000 reissue, ISBN 9781902304663). 
 Some comments: 
 *Lead 
 **""""Lady Charlotte Clark"""" – dear me, you'll upset those strange but harmless souls who sleep with Debrett under their pillows (I nearly wrote that they slept with Burke's): you mustn't call her Lady Charlotte unless she was the daughter of an earl or even posher nobleman. As her father was a commoner, she was Charlotte, Lady Clark. 
 **""""the cook Elizabeth David"""" – she was a cook, of course, but """"cookery writer"""" as you describe her later in the text seems a better description. 
 *Context 
 **""""You tell us practically nothing of the Clarks. There is a Times obituary of Sir John, dated 14 April 1910 (which I can send you if you haven't got online access to The Timess archives) which tells you more than enough for your present article. 
 **""""They lived for some years in Turin"""" – the last person named was Henry James, and I think you should write """"The Clarks lived…"""" here to avoid ambiguity. 
 **Blockquote – the parenthentic dashes should be either unspaced em-dashes or spaced en-dashes, and not hyphens. 
 *Book 
 **I don't for a moment suggest that you must do it, but have you considered putting the list of contents into two or possibly even three columns? Easier on your reader's eye, I find. 
 *Approach 
 **""""'Zucchetti à la Piedmontaise.'"""""""" – there is an extra set of closing quotes here 
 *Modern 
 **""""an inspiration for, the great Elizabeth David"""" – WP:OVERLINK at this point 
 **""""well-travelled diplomats wife"""" – I see you have faithfully transcribed the original, in which there is no possessive apostrophe. I'm not sure what to suggest here. It's too minor a matter for a [sic]; I think the MoS gives you licence to add the missing apostrophe silently. You may like to consider. 
 **In the first Holt blockquote, the quotation marks should be doubles, not singles. In the second there are more hyphens that need replacing with dashes 
 **Last blockquote – more quotation marks that should be doubles, not singles 
 *Notes 
 **""""Courgettes or Zucchini"""" – capitalisation really wanted here? 
 *References 
 **There are several mentions of """"Frere (1909)"""" but no bibliographical details of the work in the refs/citations section. They are included earlier, within the main text, but I think they should be repeated here with the refs. You should add OCLC numbers for both editions there, too: WorldCat will oblige. 
 **The links to the Find My Past site should include the {{subscription}} template 
 **You might standardise on either """"page"""" or """"p."""" in your book refs. Compare, e.g. refs 13 and 14. 
 **To my mind the bibliographical info for ref 14 should include the ISBN (or OCLC if for some reason there isn't an ISBN) 
 **Page ranges (ref 6) and date ranges (ref 14) should have an unspaced en-dash rather than a hyphen, and I should say the hyphen in ref 7 ought to be a spaced en-dash. 
 **Ref 15 – page number lacking (I can get this from the British Library after Christmas if it's a problem) 
 **Ref 16 – The Spectator should be italicised, as the TLS is in the previous ref. 
 Most of these are easy fixes, but I really would like the biography to be addressed, given that suitable sources are available. – '  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

 == My Defamation on the Diyab Article  == 

 Alright I understand. I wonder, however, if you also screen for the painful bias presented all throughout the Diyab article. This piece makes love to Diyab instead of presenting an objective account of her. It is disgusting particularly because this """"love-making"""" is in flagrant contradiction with the woman's actual merits  which are almost nonexistent. Just recently, she made a complete fool of herself on the BBC one by announcing that all Syrians are better of in their war-torn nation instead of seeking a better chance at life  she also contradicts herself too many times and is a disgrace to all people of the Levant. Of course denying innocent people the support they need does not apply to her because she is educated  unlike the """"barbarians"""" that are going to flood into England. I am not Syrian, nor am in any way affected by the topic she was addressing, but to laud someone like this even on a wiki page is not right.

 == Birther interpretations of this case need to be debunked in a level-headed fashion == 

 With respect, I'm going to revert [ this recent edit's] rewriting of the last paragraph (describing the Ankeny case).  I believe the source being offered (a piece from The Economist) is too overtly biased to be usable as the one and only secondary source for this material.  I'm not even sure I'm comfortable with using it along with a description labelling it as one opinion on the subject.  The original text of the paragraph does not, in my view, give undue weight to the """"birther"""" misinterpretation of Ankeny vs. Governor of Indiana; rather, it succinctly describes the case and shows how the Indiana appeals court used Minor v. Happersett to give the birther interpretation short shrift.  This article needs to explain what the relevant piece of Minor really means, in an even-handed and dispassionate manner, because many people will come to this article precisely because Minor is claimed by some birthers as supporting their position, and these readers need to see a fact-based explanation of what the case actually says and means.  It will come as no surprise to anyone reading the rest of this talk page that I believe the """"birther"""" view of Minor v. Happersett is not credible, but that doesn't mean we can adopt the editorializing of an unabashedly anti-birther source as the voice of Wikipedia.  —  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False
