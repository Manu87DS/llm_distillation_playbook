October to November, 1868 (Custerwest)
Gas and substitute by our (proper) Background section (based on the mil and gov websites version only).  

The battle (Custerwest)
Swap with our Battle section, based on the modern official account. Custerwest's contains the things which didn't happen, such as the discredited story of """"4 to 6 white captives"""" (discussed in detail before). I also noticed the version by Custerwest completely ommits civilian casalties (except the chief's wife).  

The accounts of the battle (mostly pre-Custerwest)
Swap with our Controversies.  

Aftermath (ours)
Addc.  

Infobox
Swap with ours - based only on the indiscussable things confirmed now, including what Custer said (which would be or not be true, but is not used in the today's estimates). Also, as always, only the government websites (AMH and Washita site). Also, I think it's more informative, and as the rest better written even (his is a mess).  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,"```json
