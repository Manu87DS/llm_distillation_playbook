 Goan Inquisition's version of Ahatallah: Defamatory article. 

The version of Ahatallah given in the article is extremely biased and insulting to even the Roman Catholic St. Thomas Christians, not to mention the non-catholic ones.This is the faulty premise/statement on which the entire article of lies and propaganda is based upon: """"However, later research by Joseph Thekedathu, relying on additional documents found in the archives in the Vatican and Goa, has established further details of his life""""

First of all the """"researcher"""" Joseph Thekedathu is known for his extreme anti-St. Thomas Christian views. He can hardly be considered a historian or researcher in the proper sense. He is a fanatic roman catholic, and all his articles(some additional websites which he maintains online) are full of hate material against the Protestants, Orthodox and Nestorian christians of India. Most of this article is based upon his """"research"""".

Also how can anyone rely on """"Vatican and Goa"""" archives to make up the history of Ahatallah? Goa is notorious as the place of the horrible catholic inquisitions in India where hundreds of saint Thomas christians, nestorian prelates, jews, muslims and hindus were burned alive at the stake. It was a former portuguese colony. There are no Saint Thomas Christians in Goa, all are Roman Catholics of the Latin rite, and Goa got independence and merged with India only in 1956, 9 years after Independence of India. Until then it was a portuguese colony.

Vatican archives or journals made in 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, midst the horrible Inquisitions cannot be considered proper hisotrical manuals to present the history of their traditional enemies- the Saint Thomas Christians of Kerala. This article is highly insulting to every Saint Thomas Christians for this reason- it is history made by its enemies and by people with an agenda to convert them.

122.172.118.114  
The second book quoted by cuchullian, ie Frykenbergs book clearly mentions that Ahatallah was a Syriac Orthodox. However Cuchullian copy pasted only the parts in stephen neills books and those quotes of Joseph Thekkedathu and presented a manipulated, concocted jesuit tale of the man Ahatallah, who is being ridiculed and mocked here as a roman catholic and agent of the Pope.

Alex, thank you for your reply.
I could indeed use a break from this case, but yesterday was a very eventful day, as the case closed and then AGK answered a question I'd initially posed on August 22, meaning that he refused to engage regarding the false allegation he made against during the brief window during which I had a chance to respond to the FoF, and then when it made the response, it not only confirmed the """"judgment on content"""" aspect of the FoF, if begs the question as to why he cited another diff including an exchange with Arzel in which Arzel not only ignores the content of academically published RS, he openly denigrates them in a thread where blocks of text of the Formisano text, for example, had been under direct discussion.

Regarding the perceived legal threat, I had no intention to make a legal threat. That was all sort of sarcastic play on words relating to specific sequence of events in the case, starting with NewYorkBrad's comment on my FoF on August 23, to which AGK refused to reply publicly until the case had been closed yesterday, more than two weeks later. There were also email exchanges between myself and NYB and AGK, which I will have to forward to Jimbo Wales at some point, after clarifying one point made by NYB on his talk page.

The import of the substance is firstly a pun insofar as I make an insinuation about sophistry in the legal field in relation to my perception that AGK aspires to become an attorney (or whatever they're called in Scotland). It is secondly an indication that I have taken the time to register at Wikipediocracy for future reference regarding earlier comments I had made about """"the court of public opinion"""". And when did a little looking around there, finding an entry about NYB, for example, who had advised AGK that he didn't see any misconduct in some of the points of the FoF, so it was thirdly an indirect suggestion that he learn something from someone that is already an accomplished attorney. 

If the reiteration of material deleted by AGK from his User page within the past two weeks is """"outing"""", then that is a policy I shall have to examine. Note that I am not the only editor to have broached the issue of his being an undergraduate in the context of his judgment and actions acting in the capacity of arbitrator in the case at issue.

There's much more to say on this, but I need to get a couple more hours of sleep. I have tried to leave links to relevant discussions at Jimbo's talk page, but have only provided a partial synthesis of the situation, not even contrasting the complete lack of an FoF on Arzel, for instance, with the response provided to me on the PD talk page shortly after the case was officially closed yesterday.

If this statement settles some of the concerns regarding my intentions, and the severity of the infractions thereby diminished, I would appreciate a reduction of the length of the block to facilitate my engaging in the necessary efforts to conduct the appeal without having to exclusively rely on the email system.  連絡 見学/迷惑 """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Bohr's Philosophy
Hello and thanks for your critique on my slight, though important changes to the article. I'd like to comment that previous to my changes, the particular part was absolute horrible writing, strictly from a stylistic point of of view, while my changes morphed that into a well balanced, clean structure that semantically integrated into the overall flow of the previous text. Furthermore, your deletion, based on arguable and vague stylistic opinion while ignoring a more important semantic correction—without which many are misled to believe that Bohr was an atheist unarguably—makes you appear to have done it in an attempt of an ideological censorship. Although I'm sure you have had no such intentions, your removal of only one side of the story points directly to your own dogmas on the subject.

As someone who, I believe, appreciates freedom of speech and honest representation of views in Wikipedia, you can understand my arguments. If you wish to discuss the style of the change, I'm more than open to discuss it with you, but I think your fine reputation ought to prevent you from silently deleting it in the future. Therefore, relying on it, I'm reposting the correction, which we can later collaboratively polish to your liking.

Finally, as we are on the subject, I have done an extensive search, and to my knowledge Bohr never called himself an atheist, and the references for this statement """"Bohr's disagreements with the philosopher mostly stemmed from Bohr's atheism"""" seem completely unsupportive of the thesis—statements by anybody but the man himself can hardly prove such a blunt declaration about such rigorous subjects as religion and philosophy.

Ken Ham's Book Evolution Exposed magically appeared in high school library. Sadly we now have three books on evolution ... Origins ... BeHe's and now Kens.

Hey Kpjas
I really don't have time to go further and report these attacks, but I would just point out to you that: - those who I was dealing with these days -they are all remaints of one destructive and defeated force, they're the ones who glorify their fascisoid NDH and fascism and who salute 'heil Hitler' at the soccer stadiums. They, the cro-nationalists, are those same ones who ruined one respected and progressive country like Yugoslavia and never regreted it. Even today they openly attack everything connected with Yugoslavia, including the ever growing collaboration and new started unification process of the former yugoslav peoples. They are the same ones, who sent their terrorists to crash yugoslavian planes in 1970's and spread hatred and separatism between ex-Yugoslavians. And now, since all the world stood against them, they're playing their dirty game with the Serbocroatian language, finding some non-existing matters, with only to them known quazi-""""sources"""". People originating from South East Europe can easily recognize and stop them, something that wikipedia should probably do too. I am actually surprised how I didn't get any support from the administrators from Srbocroatian wikipedia, because whenever something like this happened before they would have cut the cro-nationalist's edits off in the next minute:)). I hope they will do it again, whenever they are aware of what's going on. Anyhow, I wish you all the best in your editing on wikipedia, if I have time in the future - I'll join it as an editor too, and at the end I want to repeat again:- please control the cro-nationalists on wikipedia as much as you can because they are nothing but distructive elements of a defeated nationalistic propaganda, and who behind the mask of 'good people' have always some 'hidden agenda' that they're working on, luckilly with no effect.

what context does """"enlargement of government power"""" belong here?
It does not belong. Progressives do not wish to enlarge government power for the sake of enlarging government power. Progressives believe that modern society needs government intervention to ensure fair play, e.g. government regulation, and to protect the citizens, e.g. universal health care. Beck believes these are fringe views, but I do not. TFD seems to believe that believing in Progressive values is fringe, but he would be on Beck's side with side with that.
""""You have taken the quote out of context and the source is a high school textbook,""""
It is from Brittanica, and here is the full quote:
Origins of progressivism
Never were superficial signs more deceiving. Actually, the United States already was in the first stages of what historians came to call the Progressive movement. Generally speaking, progressivism was the response of various groups to problems raised by the rapid industrialization and urbanization that followed the Civil War. These problems included the spread of slums and poverty; the exploitation of labour; the breakdown of democratic government in the cities and states caused by the emergence of political organizations, or machines, allied with business interests; and a rapid movement toward financial and industrial concentration. Many Americans feared that their historic traditions of responsible democratic government and free economic opportunity for all were being destroyed by gigantic combinations of economic and political power.

Actually there was not, either in the 1890s or later, any single Progressive movement. The numerous movements for reform on the local, state, and national levels were too diverse, and sometimes too mutually antagonistic, ever to coalesce into a national crusade. But they were generally motivated by common assumptions and goals—e.g., the repudiation of individualism and laissez-faire, concern for the underprivileged and downtrodden, the control of government by the rank and file, and the enlargement of governmental power in order to bring industry and finance under a measure of popular control.
This is very non-ambiguous
This is an article from Center for American Progress the biggest Progressive group in America, and in it it describes in detail the origins of the progressive movement and it's continuance today.
""""What is progressivism?
Progressivism at its core is grounded in the idea of progress—moving beyond the status quo to more equal and just social conditions consistent with original American democratic principles such as freedom, equality, and the common good. Progressivism as an  intellectual movement emerged between 1890 and 1920 as a response to the multitude of problems associated with the industrialization of the U.S. economy—frequent economic depressions, political corruption, rising poverty, low wages, poor working conditions, tenement living, child labor, lack of collective bargaining power, unsafe consumer products, and the misuse of natural resources.
""""As a philosophical tradition, progressivism in its most complete form developed as a “new liberalism” for a new century—updating the American liberal tradition from its Jeffersonian, small-government, republican roots best suited for the agrarian economy of the nation’s founding era to a more democratic and modern liberalism capable of checking rising corporate power. The original progressives argued that changes in the economy’s organization required a more complete understanding of human freedom, equality, and opportunity that Jefferson championed so persuasively. Progressives believed that formal legal freedom alone—the negative protections against government intrusions on personal liberty—were not enough to provide the effective freedom necessary for citizens to fulfill their human potential in an age of rising inequality, paltry wages, and labor abuses. Changed conditions demanded a changed defense of human liberty.""""
With the rise of the contemporary progressive movement and the election of President Barack Obama in 2008, there is extensive public interest in better understanding the origins, values, and intellectual strands of progressivism. Who were the original progressive thinkers and activists? Where did their ideas come from and what motivated their beliefs and actions? What were their main goals for society and government? How did their ideas influence or diverge from alternative social doctrines? How do their ideas and beliefs relate to contemporary progressivism?

Titanic Historical Society  
The RMS Titanic was an Olympic-class passenger liner owned by British shipping company White Star Line and built at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast, United Kingdom. For her time, she was the largest passenger steamship in the world.

On the night of 14 April 1912, during the ship's maiden voyage, Titanic hit an iceberg and sank two hours and forty minutes later, early on 15 April 1912. The sinking resulted in the deaths of 1,517 people, making it one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history. The high casualty rate was due in part to the fact that, although complying with the regulations of the time, the ship did not carry enough lifeboats for everyone aboard. The ship had a total lifeboat capacity of 1,178 people, although her capacity was 3,547. A disproportionate number of men died due to the women-and-children-first protocol that was followed.

The Titanic used some of the most advanced technology available at the time and was popularly believed to have been described as """"unsinkable.""""[6] It was a great shock to many that, despite the extensive safety features and experienced crew, the Titanic sank. The frenzy on the part of the media about Titanic's famous victims, the legends about the sinking, the resulting changes to maritime law, and the discovery of the wreck have contributed to the continuing interest in, and notoriety of, the Titanic.

fe02cef3c6eb3a9b,"Why is an article about a Greek Orthodox theological subject being dominated by an Roman Catholic editor?
Why is Esoglou making very disproportionate (at best) Roman Catholic additions to this article? 
Why is an article about a Greek philosophy and a Greek Orthodox concept (as it is used exclusively in the present) being dominated by the editor Esoglou? Why are there recent very long additions about people like Augustine whom in their writing never used the word (because Augustine could not speak nor read Greek). Being added to an article about the very essential difference between Roman Catholic and Orthodox theologies as specifically noted by scholars of Greek Orthodox theology?  
Why is Esoglou engaging in rewriting this article to say a concept that is almost exclusive spoken of in Greek?
Why to an article about a theological concept so important to Greek Orthodox Theology that is mentioned by Greek Orthodox theologians in that way. 
Why is the actual text for the Roman Catholic church now equal to or more that the Eastern Orthodox? Even though the concept is not spoken of by the RC church per se?
Why or what evidence is there to believe (outside of what anecdotal evidence Esoglou added) that theoria is now somehow something so Roman Catholic embraces in the way the Eastern Orthodox do?
Why is Esoglou using this concept's article to ATTACK Greek theologians (John Romanides)?
Why is it Esoglou could not make his edits to the article Contemplation instead? Since he uses the excuse that the term Contemplation is the same as theoria even though that is so vague as to miss the entire point of why Greek Orthodox theologians such as John S Romanides and Metropolitan Hierotheos Vlachos use the term theoria instead of contemplation. *Why is it that it appears that Esoglou's edits confuse the whole point of the article and I can not find any Roman Catholic sources let alone encyclopedia and scholarly sources that treat this subject the way Esoglou has rewritten the article?
Why would it not seem that it is in Esoglou's best interest to discredit this theological subject because it contradicts his narrative that there is no fundamental difference between the Eastern Orthodox church and the Roman Catholic church. 
Why is it as the article is the specific difference it not to be believed that Esoglou is not POV pushing after he wrote this sentence in the article TODAY..
Contrary to what Romanides said, it is Roman Catholic teaching that God loves all, even those who choose against him, such as the devil. 
Why is in Esoglou's POV interest to either make the article incoherent, discredit the Orthodox theologians in the article or poison the well and have the article deleted wholesale?
Why (if anyone spends the time to read what has been said on this article talkpage) it is not clear that Esoglou's behavior has tried all of these things and is actively now ruining the article and running contributors off of the article as his recent reverting and rewriting of the contributions made by User:Timothy.lucas.jaeger show. 
Why does the article not reflection how this concept is being used and presented by Greek theologians but is now peppered with Esoglou's anecdotal original research? His speculation, opinions and interpretations? Why is allowed to do this to various wikipedia articles without even once being banned for an hour let alone 24 hours? LoveMonkey",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

User:GFHandel is clearly correct here. DuLithgow’s coming in and deciding that this CAD editor is that is not notable, as  was clearly way off base.

Editors are all here on en.Wikipedia to build the project. The way things are done here are the product of years of consensus building and an evolution of processes.

All these edits show the real character of the editor named Borsoka. He is considered as an irredentist editor by Romanians, Ukrainian and Serb editors.

Amazing reasons to erase Romanian references and Romanian historians text:
1. Book before WW 2   !
2. Non English reference    !
3. Scholar's view  and not scholar's argumentation (here original research of Borsoka)
4. There is no need to add scholars' POV of their opponents (but in his Hungarian history pages there are a lot of such opinions)
5. Stupid approach   (new original research of Borsoka about Romanian references)
6. Specialists are not Hungarians !

Also the user Fakirbakir erased several Romanian references because he considered 
that he personally disagree the opinions of the Romanian author and if he disagrees an author (here about Georgescu, a historian) he erases it from WIKI pages:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Origin_of_the_Romanians  (section Georgescu's statement)
""""I have to disagree with Georgescu's statement"""".

There is a simple explanation of these amazing innovations and new Wikipedia rules:
The two editors Borsoka and Fakirbakir act as a gang against editors from neighboring countries and act alternatively to avoid the 3RR rule and to eliminate
single editors. Their scope: to emphasize the priority in history of Hungarians; this is a part of the definition of IRREDENTISM: to show the priority in history, against neigbouring countries.

All these reasons made the mentioned history article to be of very bad quality due to irredentist edits. Some Romanian journals wrote about these activities in the Wikipedia pages and so Wikipedia is considered as an unreliable source for history due to these amazing edits. Unfortunately no administrator acted against these tactics.
I mentioned you the vandalism in the mentioned pages but no result.

dfcfbab39805538f,"""I think the following better captures the nature of the Investigations. The first two pargarphs have not been changed but the final three are completely different. Comments please.

Although the Tractatus is a major work, Wittgenstein is mostly studied today for the Philosophical Investigations (Philosophische Untersuchungen). In 1953, two years after Wittgenstein's death, the long-awaited book was published in two parts. Most of the 693 numbered paragraphs in Part I were ready for printing in 1946, but Wittgenstein withdrew the manuscript from the publisher. The shorter Part II was added by the editors, G.E.M. Anscombe and Rush Rhees. (Had Wittgenstein lived to complete the book himself, some of the remarks in Part II would likely have been incorporated into Part I, and the book would no longer have this bifurcated structure.)
It is notoriously difficult to find consensus among interpreters of Wittgenstein's work, and this is particularly true of the Investigations. Very briefly, Wittgenstein asks the reader to think of language and its uses as sets of language-games within which the parts of language function and have meaning in order to resolve the problems of philosophy. This view of language represents what many consider a break from the Wittgenstein in the Tractatus and, hence, meaning as representation. In the carrying out of such an investigation, one of the most radical characteristics of the """"later"""" Wittgenstein comes to light. The """"conventional"""" view of philosophy's """"task"""", perhaps coming to a head in Bertrand Russell, is that the philosopher's task is to solve the seemingly intractable problems of philosophy using logical analysis (for example, the problem of """"free will"""", the relationship between """"mind"""" and """"matter"""", what is """"the good"""" or """"the beautiful"""" and so on). However, Wittgenstein argues that these """"problems"""" are, in fact, """"bewitchments"""" that arise from the philosophers' misuse of language.
On Wittgenstein's account, language is woven into the fabric of life, and it is within this ordinary everyday context that language actually operates. Philosophical problems arise, on this account, when language is forced out of the everyday context that is its proper home, and is forced into a new, metaphysical, environment, where all the familiar and necessary landmarks have been deliberately removed. Removed for what appear to be sound philosophical reasons, but which are, for Wittgenstein, the very source of the problem. Wittgenstein describes this metaphysical environment as like being on frictionless ice; where the conditions are apparently perfect for a philosophically and logically perfect language (the language of the Tractatus), and where all philosophical problems can be solved without the confusing and muddying effects of everyday contexts; but where, just because of the lack of friction, language can in fact do no actual work at all. There is much talk in the Investigations, then, of “idle wheels,” and language being “on holiday”, all of which are used to express this same idea of what is lacking in philosophical contexts. To resolve the problems encountered there, Wittgenstein argues, philosophers must “bring words back from their metaphysical to their everyday use.” That is, philosophers must leave the frictionless ice and return to the “rough ground” of ordinary language in use. 
Returning to the rough ground is, however, easier said than done. Philosophical problems having the character of depth, and running as deep as the forms of language and thought that have become habitual for the philosopher. Wittgenstein therefore speaks of “illusions” and “conjuring tricks” performed on our thinking by our forms of language and tries to break their spell by attending to differences between the superficially similar forms of expression that can lead to this type of confusion. For much of the Investigations, then, Wittgenstein tries to show how philosophers are led away from the ordinary world of language in use by misleading aspects of language itself. He does this by looking in turn at the development of various philosophical problems, from the general problem of language itself, through the notions of rules and rule following, and then on to some more specific problems in epistemology and philosophy of mind. Throughout these investigations, the style of writing is conversational with Wittgenstein in turn taking the role of the puzzled philosopher (on either or both sides of traditional philosophical debates), and that of the guide attempting to show the puzzled philosopher the way back: the “way out of the fly bottle.”  
Much of the Investigations, then, consists of examples of how philosophical confusion is generated and how, by a close examination of the actual workings of everyday language, the first false steps towards philosophical puzzlement can be avoided. By avoiding these first false steps, philosophical problems themselves simp",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

 Not sure why we beat around the bush in not just saying she was crushed by a bulldozer 

All three of the first three sources cited about the cause of her death (the film Occupation 101, The Guardian, and Time) state that she was killed by a bulldozer, whether you want to call it an accident or not. Trying to reference which aspect of being bulldozed, such as """"debris"""" falling from the bulldozer, as the IDF reworded it, is a way of psychologically distancing the person operating the bulldozer for the IDF from having any direct responsibility for the action. None of the three sources state it was caused by """"debris."""" So the source citations should be moved closer to the statement that the witnesses said she was caught """"underneath."""" Currently the three citations have been placed next to a phrase that none of them reference. Therefore the sentence should be broken into two parts. The part about the IDF referencing """"debris"""" should have whatever citation mentions it next to that sentence, but none of the three sources cited references debris at all. 

Here is what they do say:

1. http://occupiedpalestine.wordpress.com/2010/12/26/occupation-101-full-movie-in-11-parts/  Part 6 of 7 after about 7:41, the film Occupation 101 (2006) states """"she got caught underneath the bulldozer""""; """"When Rachel Corrie was killed, she was protecting a doctor's home""""; """"The U.S. Congress has refused her parents' request for an independent investigation in her murder.""""  This source said nothing about debris accidentally falling on her. 

2. """"Corrie, 23, was crushed to death by an army bulldozer in Rafah, Gaza, as she protested against house demolitions."""" -The Guardian. This newspaper simply states she was """"crushed to death by the bulldozer.""""

3. """"Rachel Corrie was a 23-year-old American from Olympia, Wash., who was crushed to death by an Israeli Army bulldozer March 16, 2003. Corrie was in the Gaza Strip, working with the International Solidarity Movement, which opposes Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and living among Palestinians whose homes were being demolished. She was kneeling in front of a home, acting as a human shield, when she was bulldozed."""" - Time.     
Again, here we are told she was """"crushed to death"""" and """"bulldozed."""" Nothing about debris accidentally falling.

I or someone else should put the citations next to a phrase about the bulldozer killing her. How exactly it killed her (whether dropping stuff on her or rolling over her) is speculative. None of the three sources reference debris. If the IDF """"debris"""" statement must be included it should be a separate sentence. The IDF operated the machine and have a potential self protection conflict of interest in their wording.

I'd feel better if it said something like: 

""""She was crushed by a bulldozer's operations clearing land in front of a Palestinian doctor's home.[1,2,3] An IDF investigation reported she died after being struck by falling debris.[source??]""""

(More accurate for the IDF part of it would be """"by debris falling from the bulldozer."""" I'd probably rather it say the IDF """"claimed"""" rather than """"reported"""" but I'm not going to change that part.)

In an effort to assess the progress of Wikiproject Cheshire, it has been decided to send a questionnaire to members. To answer, please copy this questionnaire and paste your answers on the answer page. While participation is, of course, not compulsory, thoughtful answers will help the project to develop and improve. Thank you.

1. The project is always looking for new members, so we want to find out which ways of attracting and approaching potential members work best. Do you remember how and why you joined?
Answer:

2. How would you describe your involvement in the project? What activities do you undertake and how often do you edit Cheshire-related article?
Answer:

3. Do you feel like you receive adequate support/contact from project members?

Answer:

4a. If the talk page was more active, would you get involved in discussions there?
Answer:

5. When viewing Cheshire-related articles, are there any issues that have stood out as needing attention or frustrated you? (Traditional counties POV, poor coverage about a particular subject, vandalism going unnoticed etc)
Answer:

6. Maintaining the Cheshire portal is one of the Cheshire WikiProject's main aims, providing a display of the best and most up to date articles that are part of the project. There is currently a drive to promote it to featured status, but input from a wide range of members is needed. Do you have the portal on your watchlist?

Anyways, when they lie they do get away with it. Which is why I'm going to answer this question now. 

Girls lie so they don't have to get in trouble, girls hate getting in trouble and then they rebel when they get grounded and a lot of fighting goes on. Also they'd always rather have their friend or another person in trouble but them. So take this for example, Tashya (made up the name) does something bad. And she knows she'll get in trouble for it.

So if his critic is in any way or form relevant, why not settle it once for all and end with austrians, or if he doesn't want to lose his time on irrelevant things, he has humanitarian incentive (or why call out austrians in a first place?)...  So all in all, it comes to this, either criticizer and critic is irrelevant and should be deleted, or what is in my opinion far better solution, this discrepancy should be there for readers to know and decide for themselves.

a6ee255d5deb3bdf,""" and sounding similar to the English word nigger are used without the disparaging connotation the word holds in English. The French cognate , however, commonly used during the colonial period, is similarly considered offensive, whereas  (literally, """"black"""") is the standard word, with the Anglicism black being a common slang term.

Interestingly, in some places these words refer to people with an only slightly darker appearance than those native to Northern Europe, i.e. people who might be said to have a typically Mediterranean, Southern European/Eastern European appearance without any facial or hair-texture characteristics associated with black people. There are also socio-economic reasons behind this as southern Europeans but particularly eastern Europeans are stereotypically deemed more backwards and less well off than their northern European cousins.

Forms ultimately derived from Latin  have been borrowed into various non-Romance languages, and may be used to refer to people without negative connotation; The Hungarian  referred to black Africans without any negative connotations until the 1990s when its meaning changed under English influence. In Latvian, """"nēģeris"""" is still referred to black Africans without any derogatory meaning. The word nigger, typically with the same spelling and more or less similar pronunciation, also appears as a loanword in languages other than English and has the same racist connotations as the English word. In Nazi propaganda, the German compound niggerjazz was used as a derogatory term for jazz music, which Nazi ideology held was a degenerate form of music. In Yiddish, """"shvartzer"""", meaning 'black' is considered offensive while """"neger"""" is the standard word.

Non-human uses
In the past, nigger was sometimes used as a synonym for """"defect"""", deriving from the phrase """"nigger in the woodpile"""", which originally referred to escaping slaves hiding among woodpiles being transported on trains. It came to mean some unseen problem.Definition of nigger in the woodpile For example, the May 1886 issue of Scientific American, page 308 said, """"The consequence of neglect might be that what the workmen call ‘a nigger’ would get into the armature, and burn it so as to destroy its service.""""

The term nigger was used in lumber mills until the mid-point of the 20th century. It refers to a device that turns a log while it is being stripped of its bark. This may be an off-hand reference to the prejudicial use of the word, as until the machine was invented, this was considered a job too dangerous for anyone other than a black man.

Literary uses
Nigger has a long history of controversy in literature. Carl Van Vechten, a white photographer and writer famous as a supporter of the Harlem Renaissance, provoked debate and some protest from the African American community by titling his 1926 novel Nigger Heaven. The controversy centered on the use of the word in the title and fueled the sales of the hit novel. Of the controversy, Langston Hughes wrote:

The poem Little Topsy's SongLittle Topsy's Song: Sung by the Hutchinson family A modern recording. Music by Asa B. Hutchinson(1823–1884), Boston: Oliver Ditson, 1853Little Topsy's Song: Text and Sources Music by Asa Hutchinson and also by Henry Russell (1801–1900) written in about 1845 by Eliza Cook has the first stanza
'Topsy neber was born, / Neber had a moder; / Specks I growed a nigger brat, / Just like any oder.

The famous controversy over Mark Twain's novel Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885), a classic frequently taught in American schools, revolves largely around the novel's 215 uses of the word, often referring to Jim, Huck's raft mate.{{cite web

The succession boxes don't really make much sense in this context.

Personally, I think a better idea would be to create a sub-category of Category:Superman actors called Category:Actors portraying Lex Luthor or something similar.

I am all for mentioning Nick Clegg as Deputy Prime Minister in the article, around the same place David Cameron is currently described as Prime Minister, but to put Clegg alongside the Queen and Prime Minister on the basis of it being a coalition government is not right. Now if the job were constitutionally defined as being the Prime Minister's second-in-command, and if Cameron were to die/resign suddenly Clegg would become Prime Minister, I would completely agree that he should be there, but it isn't.

http://fornvannen.se/pdf/1980talet/1983_021.pdf
This article was edited and approved by the previous editor of Fornvännen Fil Dr Jan-Peder Lamm 
Fornvännen is a highly reputable magazine
Göran H. wrote the article in 1982.  Jan-Peder Lamm edited the article but  suggested that Göran H. should include a comparison with Stonehenge. Therefore did J-P L supply Göran H. with archaeological history about Stonehenge. Göran H. re-wrote the article with comparison with Stonhenge and the article was published in 1983.

Jan-Peder Lamm, born 27 October 1935, is a Swedish archaeologist. He received his PhD in 1973 from the University of Stockholm for a dissertation about a Migration Period elite cemetery near Drottningholm.
Lamm taught archaeology at the University of Stockholm in the 1970s and then worked until retirement as Head Curator for the Swedish Iron Age at the Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm. He is a member of the editorial board behind the journal Fornvännen and has taken active part in the Helgö project since the 1960s.
Fornvännen (print: ISSN 0015-7813, online: ISSN 1404-9430) is a Swedish academic journal in the fields of archaeology and Medieval art. It is published quarterly by the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters in Stockholm, Sweden. The journal's contributions are written in the Scandinavian languages, English, or German with summaries in English. Fornvännen has the alternate title Journal of Swedish Antiquarian Research. The editor in chief is Lars Larsson.
Fornvännen began publication in 1906 when it replaced two earlier journals, Svenska Fornminnesföreningens Tidskrift and Vitterhetsakademiens Månadsblad. Early contributors included noted archaeologists Oscar Montelius and Hans Hildebrand.[1] Since 2000 it has an online version, since 2007 its first 100 annual volumes have been available on-line, and since 2009 Fornvännen is published as a delayed open-access journal with the online version of each issue appearing six months after the paper version.
Fornvännen is an ERIH category B journal. According to Ulrich's, it is indexed in Anthropological Index Online, Anthropological Literature, British & Irish Archaeological Bibliography (Online Edition), Nordic Archaeological Abstracts, and FRANCIS. It was previously also indexed in Internationale Bibliographie der Rezensionen Geistes- und Sozialwissenschaftlicher Literatur and Linguistic Bibliography.[2]

My worry is the number of editors who would scrutinise your every movement. On WikiSource you don't have as much history so there are less people watching you. It would be a much more pressured environment for you. Can you remain calm in these circumstances?

I don't intend to get involved in the award culture on Wikipedia such  FAC, FAR or other areas where editors are competitively vested in collecting awards.

Secondly, I would create articles that are needed for explanations for Wikisource articles. I will stay away from any article that belongs to a vested editor, where an editor lists and article under articles """"I wrote"""" or refers to """"my articles"""" in posts.

I have created over 600 articles in a multitude of subjects, mostly to fill in """"missing links"""" on Wikipedia. I will continue with low key endeavors such as that. However, at the sign of any """"push back"""" I will simply not continue editing the article or dealing with that editor, or even editing Wikipedia for a while.

History and Giving Context for Atlanta Demographics - adding numbers to population chart
While Fulton County did not encompass all of what is in the Atlanta SMSA today, I think it is misleading to provide only Atlanta City population numbers in the mid-19th c. While it was established as a railroad terminus, it didn't exist by itself.

In 1860 Fulton County had a total of 14,427 people.  There were 2955 enslaved African-Americans, 20.5% of the population.  While much of north GA had mostly yeoman farmers, both Cobb and Fulton County also had planters (defined by historians as holding 20 or more slaves), who held slaves for labor on large cotton plantations. 

(I know more about Roswell in Cobb county, than Fulton, but the origins of major planters and the slaves they brought with them are likely similar. Roswell King and planters he invited to join him in his enterprise (at what became Roswell) were from the coast. King brought 36 slaves from his coastal plantation and bought another 42 at Darien, GA, to take with him to work on building his house, the mill, and supporting buildings. Archibald Smith brought 36 slaves with him from his coastal plantations in St. Marys County and created a 300-acre cotton plantation in Roswell. King's idea was to have cotton production AND  processing in the same place. The forced migration of slaves from the coast to north GA meant they brought their unique Geechee culture and language with them.  Where slaves were held in larger numbers on plantations, it's likely they kept their culture and traditions going.) 

Atlanta and Fulton County in fact more than doubled in population from 1860 to 1870. People rushed to rebuild the city.  In a pattern typical of other areas, many newly freed African-Americans left plantations to move to town to work at trades or crafts, to have safety in numbers and to try to set up lives apart from white control.  

By 1870 Fulton County had grown to 33,446 people.  Among them were 15,282 """"colored"""", as defined by the census, 45.7% of the population. 

NOTEWORTHY CITIZENS: Atlanta boasts two Nobel Prize winners: Rev. Martin Luther King, the youngest man to receive the Nobel Prize, and President Jimmy Carter.  Each were awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace.

Hi,

We started a proposal Wikipedia:Wikiethics to state the existing policies coherently and make suggestions on improving the editorial standards in Wiki. I thought you might be interested in contributing to that proposal.

Unfortunately, a pro-porn and pro-offense lobby is trying to make this proposal a failure. They unilaterally started an approval poll although almost no one including me believe that it is time for a vote, simply because the policy is not ready. It is not even written completely. 

Editors who thinks that the policy needs to be improved rather than killed by an unfair poll at the beginning of the proposal, started another poll ('Do we really need a poll at this stage?') at the same time. The poll is vandalized for a while but it is stable now. A NO vote on this ('Do we really need a poll now?') poll will strengthen the position of the editors who are willing to improve the ethics policy further. 

If you have concerns about the ethics and editorial standards in Wiki, please visit the page Wikipedia:Wikiethics with your suggestions on the policy. We have two subpages: Arguments and Sections. You might want to consider reviewing these pages as well...

fd56e8378b1bb059,"P.S. On further reflection, I see that there is at least one point that I clearly overstated in our discussion. Sources for 2000s (decade) do not, in fact, have to be explicitly about the decade. They can be about, say, events that happened at some point during the decade. For example, a retrospective source about the 21st century, published before 2010, almost certainly is acceptable as a source about the 2000s. It is, after all, from these types of sources that time lines are constructed. Beneath my cynical tone (as it strikes me now in retrospect) was the idea that one can't infer too much from sources, as such inference might amount to original research. If a source says that X is characteristic of the 21st century or of modernity in general, that source (at least in principle) certainly may be used to help put the 2010s decade (insofar as it is part of the 21st century and of modernity) into context. Statement X just shouldn't be used clearly to characterize item A on Wikipedia, when it clearly is meant to characterize item B in the source. This probably is what I should have said back in January, and I apologize for making my case in such an inflected voice. Also, I take it that your first language is not English, so I should have been more sensitive to the possibility of unintentional offense.

24276ea1d0eddfe0,"Regular disclaimer on vandal User:Rovoam 

Dear fellow Wikipedians,

This IP is just one of a whole army of anon IPs used by a well-known vandal User:Rovoam, who without exagerration deserves to be included in the history of Wikipedia as THE most persistent and obsessed vandal that has appeared in Wikipedia so far.

This person has been extremely persistent and obsessive in vandalizing numerous Azerbaijan and Turkey-related entries, such as Nagorno-Karabakh, Caucasian Albania, Artsakh, Arran (Azerbaijan), Urartu, Azerbaijan, Azerbaijan (disambiguation), Turkey, Kura-Araxes culture, Nakhichevan, Safavids, Karabakh, Khojaly, Khojaly massacre, Stepanakert, Khankendi, Ganja (city), Baku Demographics of Azerbaijan, History of Azerbaijan, Azerbaijani language, Azeri, Caucasus, History of Turkey, Oghuz Turks, Ottoman Empire, Turks, Turkic languages, Turkic peoples, Mannaeans and even Template:Europe (removing Azerbaijan and Turkey from the list).

He also vandalized user pages and talkpages, including User:Tabib, User:Tony Sidaways, (user page and talkpages), User talk:Rdsmith4, User talk:CryptoDerk  (talkpages), User:Weyes, User:Dante Alighieri, User:Chanting Fox.

Since the person uses wide range of IPs, it is virtually impossible to stop him by blocking. In the past he's been blocked numerous times but each time returned with a new IP. That's why the admins chose to vprotect most of the above mentioned pages (some of them more than once).

Rovoam started his actions in Wikipedia from introducing nationalistic POV edits in Nagorno-Karabakh yet back in February 2005. His aggressive discussion behaviour, unilateral un-agreed changes to the entry, and most importantly malicious tricks and manipulations with the history logs have quickly caused a conflict involving him and several other editors, with myself being his major opponent. 

The conflict was formally decided after Arbitration committee placed him under one-year revert limitation and personal attack parole . However, this decision made Rovoam even more radical and obsessive, as he kept to deliberately vandalize and disrupt Wikipedia, perhaps out of his personal feeling of hatred towards me (?for exposing him and proving him wrong?..). 

This person is very wily and smart which makes him rather dangerous. He is not the usual sort of vandal, but is rather knowledgeable in what he's dealing with. He could have been very valuable for Wikipedia if not his intentions and vandalisms. Rovoam is very able in manipulating with people by playing on history logs and various other means. His edits sometimes are misleading and not obvious. 

As I have numerously stated in my communication with a number of other editors including but not limited to User:Tony Sidaway, User:Codex Sinaiticus, User:Isomorphic, User:Who, User:Dbachmann, the only way effective to deal with this person is for other editors to unite and withstand all his spurious edits and vandalisms. Only then will he understand the whole senselessness of his actions.

 Introduction 

""""Stephens City celebrated its semiquincentennial, or 250th anniversary, on September 1, 2008. A large section of the center of the town, comprising 65 acres (26 ha), is part of the Newtown-Stephensburg Historic District, listed in 1992 on the National Register of Historic Places.""""

This paragraph in the introduction consists of two completely unrelated subjects. The 250th anniversary is already mentioned later in the article, so this sentence can probably be removed. The historic district sentence, then, could be incorporated somewhere else in the article. In fact, it is mentioned in the """"20th century to present"""" section so maybe we can move it there. I will make these changes tomorrow if no one objects.

Also, as I mentioned in my edit comment, I think the word """"semiquincentennial"""" should be removed. If a word is so obscure that you have to clarify what it means, why not just use the clarification instead? It looks a like a case of using a big word for the sake of using a big word.

Why Wikipedia Can't Work
Wikipedia claims (or is promoted by its users as) a replacement for the traditional encyclopedia. They frequently compare themselves to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, but in reality Wikipedia is not an adequate substitute, let alone a replacement. What's more, because of fundamental problems in Wikipedia's philosophy, design, and operation, it would appear impossible for Wikipedia to ever become such a substitute. 

There are many problems with Wikipedia, some more important than others. I'll discuss only two that have bitten me in the past. 

The Ignorant Edit-Bully
Many people have noted this phenomenon, though I've never seen a good name for it before. In a nutshell, the problem is that a person knowledgable in a given field (but not a regular Wikipedia contributor) notices an obvious error in a page devoted to a topic in that field. They want to be a good citizen, so they edit the page and correct the error. However, within minutes, their correction has been reverted, restoring the error, and if they're particularly unlucky, they may receive a note from the person that reverts their change, accusing them of """"page vandalism"""". 

It seems that there are a large number of Wikipedia devotees or zealots who have little more to do than hang around the Wikipedia site, watching for edits to pages that they've contributed to. Any change to """"their"""" page is taken as a personal insult and instantly reverted, regardless of its merit. What's worse is that the types of people who do this simply do not have the knowledge or intellectual tools to recognize the merit of the contribution. They would appear to typically be young people, perhaps in their first couple of years of college. They have the headstrong ignorance of the young adult, coupled with an insecurity complex that makes them unable to accept that others might have something to contribute that they themselves lack. In """"real life"""" they would be harmless, as they wouldn't be able to stand up to others in a confrontation, but the anonymity and isolation of the internet give them the confidence to become overly assertive. 

So an expert makes a contribution, sees it discarded by someone who obviously has no qualifications to judge it and all the time in the world to get their own way, and the expert simply leaves, never to contribute to Wikipedia again. The quality of many of Wikipedia's articles clearly shows this phenomenon; reading through the edit history of many pages shows it in action, graphically. 

No Editors Means No Sense of the Valuable
Wikipedia prides itself on not relying on professional editors, which they claim makes Wikipedia more egalitarian. However, egalitarianism is not necessarily a desirable quality in a reference work, as the philosophy of everyones contributions being equally valuable is simply untrue in the real world. As Theodore Sturgeon noted, """"ninety percent of everything is [crap]"""". 

This leads to the problem of many of the Wikipedia articles having been created or primarily edited by the """"edit bullies"""" described above: 

They do not necessarily have a broad knowledge of any of the topics they write about. 
They are generally not well-read or broadly-educated, having little context for the particular areas they have studied in any depth. 
They tend to have concentrated their reading on various things of personal interest to them, so they have no sense of proportion or of what is truly significant to the world, versus the trivia that was important to them as teenagers and such 
This results in the Wikipedia in general having laughably large holes in the areas it covers, while having an even more ridiculous amount of spurious detail on subjects that it has no need to cover. My current favourite example: 

Many Wikipedia articles about important historical figures are little more than caricatures, if they have sufficient details to even be called that. Many other important figures are simply not mentioned in Wikipedia at all. A number of months ago, I looked for information on an important North American manufacturing industry figure from the 1980s; he could be considered the most important business person of the decade. I was somewhat shocked to see that there was no article about him at all. Note that I am not identifying him by name; this is because Wikipedia tends to react quickly to correct specific faults only when those particular faults are widely publicized, in order to render that particular critique null. 

So, being a good naive contributor, I created the article. I noted who he was, why he was famous, a few of his most important accomplishments, and I properly notated the article as being a people-related article stub, hoping others would help flesh it out. A few weeks later, I checked back, only to find that the article had been c",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

The problem, precisely, is that if you assume that there is an underlying structure [noun] is raining [object], then from the very start you deny the possibility that the pronoun before the verb is in fact meaningless, i. e. a dummy word. If the pronoun refers to a noun and you can say what this noun is, then by definition it's not a dummy pronoun. My contention is that (maybe) the verb is really impersonal, i. e. its subject is truly a dummy word, not meant to mean anything but only appearing there to fill a syntactic slot.

The definition given at the start of the article is not sourced appropriately, I know; it just covers what I think are the features of what linguists call """"dummy pronoun"""", based on my amateur experience on the matter.

Should the British EngD be mentioned in the article as a """"professional doctorate"""" ?

A few English universities now offer the degree of """"Doctor of Engineering"""" (EngD), which, like the PhD, is also a research-based degree, but differs from the traditional UK PhD in several important ways. Specifically,

1) A PhD degree is normally pursued full-time by a student while in residence in a university department under the supervision of a faculty member. Accordingly, PhD-level research is more speculative/abstract in nature, with an emphasis on producing results that may be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and are of academic interest. 

2) The EngD on the other hand is normally pursued by a candidate while he/she works as an employee in an outside company. Most EngD research is carried out in a designated industry (as opposed to a university department or lab) and is jointly supervised by both an industrial and a university supervisor. Accordingly, EngD-level research tends to be application-oriented in nature and designed to meet the specific needs/interests of the industrial sponsor. EngD candidates are still required to produce original research that makes a significant contribution to existing knowledge on his/her field, but, in many programmes (AmEng """"programs""""), it is customary for EngD candidates to submit a portfolio of engineering projects in lieu of a longer monographic thesis to fulfil (AmEng """"fulfill"""") the requirements for the degree.

3) EngD programmes normally include a more formal coursework requirement than the traditional English PhD. It should be stressed however that many engineering departments in the UK (e.g. at Cambridge) now require that PhD students take lecture courses and their associated written exams in their first year in the programme. 

4) (POV) No matter what the Research Councils say, the EngD is still generally seen in academic circles as inferior to a PhD. For example, I doubt an EngD would be acceptable as a qualification for appointment as a Lecturer in a university, whereas the PhD of course is the standard qualification in England for an entry-level faculty position. 

Because of its industry-oriented nature, the EngD is normally referred to in English academic circles as a """"professional degree"""", even though it remains a research degree as emphasized above

If it is not about profits release all three volumes at once, don’t wait for the money that will be generated from three separate hard cover and paperback releases for each volume.

More then likely there was a large advance granted to mr jordan upon the start of the book and unless the book is finished Harriet more then likely would have had to return that money due tyo the book being unfinished. Sorry folks but medical bills aren’t cheap and when some Corporation has you under contract you have no choice but to at least pretend you have some sort of control. Face it this is a business and the world is in a recession what is the garunteed way to bring in SOME MONEY? Plump up a story and add meaningless splits and’ milk it for everything it is worth, Corporate GREED at its finest again. don’t punish Harriet and not buy the books but BOYCOTT ANY OTHER WORK BY TOR OR SANDERSON UNTIL THE LAST VOLUME IS COMPLETE. WHO KNOWS THEY MIGHT EVEN HAVE IT FINISHED BY NEXT YEAR IF ALL THE FANS BOYCOTT BOOK PURCHASING FROM THEM. PLEASE CONTINUE TO EXPRESS YOUR ANGER UNTIL WE HEAR A TRUTHFUL ANSWER FROM ANYONE OF THESE KNUCKLE HEADS.

A rivalry requires that there be more than 1 side competing (for whatever) - if this """"rivalry"""" is """"basically unacknowledged"""" by Caltech, then I would suggest that terming it as a rivalry is quite PoV.

cf91cf4df80db8dd,"Long wave, because of the long wavelength, needs impractically large antennas to broadcast with any reasonable efficiency. The tallest ever man-made structure before the Burj Khalifa was a longwave transmitter: Warsaw radio mast. Its ground wave range is also relatively long compared to medium wave, which means that the transmissions will reach out over a much wider area (1000 km is not unusual). That may sound like an advantage, but at such low frequencies, bandwidth is at a premium, so the longwave band has to be rather small (it's just over 100 kHz wide in Europe). Combine those two effects, and and what happens is that a single medium-powered transmitter will swamp a very large area, making that frequency unusable to anyone else, and taking away almost 10% of the available frequency space within that wide area. So the longwave band is good purely from a transmission effectiveness point of view (if you ignore lightning interference) but it doesn't work too well on a economical/commercial level. This is one of the reasons the FM band was moved from 50 MHz to its modern place after WW2: the higher frequencies are much more strongly localised to one area, so there is room for a lot more stations in a given space and stations can cater more easily to smaller, local audiences, which keeps costs down and attracts more people.

Greetings Mikhailov, Thanks for the welcome and your generous suggestions! I particularly like the four waves and will incorporate that in my modus operandi. I wish I had more time to edit, although that is not my calling, yet I'd love to help. Here I am just trying to keep my two Cuba books (I'm the author) in the further reading sections... Yes, another self serving bastard. For me it is difficult to stay on top of this alone. I do have several questions that you certainly could answer, yet if you will is another matter entirely. 

1) When there is no further reading section, should I A) create one or B) add the information in the reference section (I feel that may be a faux pas)or C) do something else like ... run Forrest run? 
 
2) Unfortunately I have not had anyone write a bio for me... yet. I'm afraid I am responding at a poor time because while I usually dominate Google searches with my books, interviews, and my Blog at Sulekha, at the moment I am a distant second on the first page. Sadly, I share the name of Charles Spencer King with the inventor of the Range Rover.... This confuses many a seeker as you might imagine. Regrettably, Mr. King (the other) died in the last month, and that has thrown the proverbial monkey wrench into the rankings (Addendum: I assure you I am alive and well).

    I would love to at the very least get into the Disambiguation section, however I am afraid I would need a bio for that.... Am I correct? 

 3) For some reason my ISBN does not seem to work here despite the fact I am on everything from Amazon through the Library Thing....and everything between. Odd, yet I would be delighted if at the very least I could get this to go to either the individual page at Amazon or the title page ( this one:)    http://www.amazon.com/Charles-Spencer-King/e/B002ELIWKI/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_1

Well as for Bynes her father's surname doesn't really match either, does it? I find surnames in 2006 can be grossly misleading and don't necessarily mean much. In 1900, sure, but at this point everyone's changed their names and intermarried enough that you can't tell who is what by last name. Why wouldn't Eli's father be Jewish? He's Joseph Cross, also the father of actress Flora Cross, who is Jewish but whose mother is apparently not Eli's mother. There are seemingly a bunch of Jewish """"Cross""""'s out there, anyway. Well in the case of footnotes the point is really - the list is called a list of Jewish people - so the most important part is really whether the person themselves is """"Jewish"""". The mistake I guess many made before is thinking that the most important part was whether one of their parents or something are Jewish. I think adding a quote about Elvis' ancestry however is important since in his case it is a big stretch and it's for the most part, something that biographers added on after his death, so it would definitely be helpful. But in cases like Bynes, Lauren Storm, plenty of others it's really mostly irrelevant if they are not """"ethnically"""" fully Jewish (and besides, that can be found out in their entry), same for the other X-American lists, establishing that someone is Italian-American is good enough, for example, on List of Italian American actors, I'm sure Tina Majorino's mother isn't Italian (with Italians, unlike Jews, you can obviously tell that if someone's mother's maiden name is """"Black"""" they are most likely not Italian) but the source just calls her Italian, so that's good enough for us. Family tree stuff isn't the most important. Plus - of course - most of the quotes in the numbers for people who are half already say they are half - but I'll go over them below here.

But this was removed once I came in and started purging these assumption games other editors played and started putting in only verified facts )), Bilson quote says she is half Italian half Jewish, ditto for Baldoni, Paxton quote says all we know, that she is Jewish (maybe her non-Jewish parent converted), Peck grew up with a Jewish single mother, he doesn't know who his biological father was and he was likely Jewish anyway, Prepon we don't know which parent, Reed's brother had a Bar Mitzvah and sources/herself have called her """"Jewish"""", Schwartzman - dunno, Sigler mother converted, Thomas raised Jewish, and the source says his father isn't anyway, Vuolo father converted, Wilson raised Jewish, I think that's about it.

Wikipedia also contains biographies of people who, while notable enough for an entry, are not generally well known. In such cases, exercise restraint and include only material relevant to their notability, while omitting information that is irrelevant to the subject's notability.

Material that may adversely affect a person's reputation should be treated with special care. In the laws of many countries, simply repeating the defamatory claims of another is illegal, and there are special protections for people who are not public figures.

 Why will Gwen Gale not read the sources? 

On 01:27, 5 August 2010 I posted a section on """"Talk: Death of Adolf Hitler"""" titled “Random Questions” which started “I am not a scholar, I read Wiki but would not think of editing it. But I was disappointed in this article, and many points in the discussion, so I am asking some questions. Perhaps someone else will read and address them.” The section went on with several rethoritical questions, and ended with “As to sources, the last books I have read are The Murder of Adolph Hitler by Hugh Thomas (sort of shaky) and The Last Days of Hitler by Anton Joachimsthaler (English translation, I buy much of this).”

Gwen Gale was apparently assigned me as an administrator, because at  she replied with: ”As the article lead says,...This said, this talk page isn't a forum for talking about personal views or questions on a topic, it's meant for talking about sources and how to echo them in the text. I say this because the article seems to already cover, with thorough citations, most if not all of what you've brought up...dodgy. Gwen Gale (talk)”

By this reply it appears that Gwen Gale is NOT FAMILIAR with the work of Joachimsthaler, who I have just referenced, and thinks that I am asking a personal question, not a rhetorical one. At that time I apologized, tried to explain myself, and restate my questions.

At  I posted” If I had read Kershaw's Nemesis Chapter 17 note 156 and Epilogue note 1 I wouldn't have wasted your time. You can't get much clearer than that. Should be required reading. Perhaps someone else should read them, and possibly edit the article. Thank you for your time.99.41.251.5 (talk)”

At  I posted “I would like to direct people to the work of Ian Kershaw Hitler, 1939-1945: Nemesis ISBN 0393322521. Chapter 17 and the epilogue relate to this article. Please pay attention to his notes and sources. Be warned, his book Hitler: a Biography is a kind of digest which does not include these resources....The source Joachimsthaler is basically an English translation of a German's analysis of 1950's post-Soviet interviews of bunker survivors. The original transcripts must be available somewhere. There are many other bunker interviews, some with questionable intent, and not all agree. Wm5200 (talk)“

Since those posts I have posted a huge amount on the talk page, virtually all of which Gwen Gale has disputed. Much of the material I have posted I have later deleted, often because I felt that the endless conflict between Gwen Gale and myself is counterproductive to the article.

Anyone who is Wiki can probably bring back any of those posts. Was I sometimes rude and argumentative? Absolutely. Was I making legitimate points which related to the article? I thought so. Did I receive effective support and encouragement by my administrator? I think not, but you judge.

My main point was that Joachimsthaler had reviewed the information, and had made a solid case for positions which Kershaw backed. I repeatedly begged anyone, especially Gwen Gale, to read Joachimsthaler and Kershaw, specifically, two footnotes, I even told the pages of the footnotes. Gwen Gale clearly had not read either source.

 I posted, under the heading “Question for Gwen Gale” , the following: ”I lost you, but I’m confused myself. It appears as though the person with the least information available is most influential on the article.

The U.S. is big on free press, and it works. My very low budget suburb is in a system which serves 225,000 people with 4 MILLION titles (numbers approximate, thanks Carol). That’s on the next shuttle van. Most of the rest of the assets of a state with 12 million people are a couple of days away by mail. The specialty stuff on AE from Radcliffe took maybe a week. And I am an amateur. Dan, you are over three million people higher in the food chain, you must be “world class”. Kierzek has clearly read and analyzed everything, reviewed most of it, and as far as I can tell, every word he says is accurate and informed.

Kershaw, Joachimsthaler, Thomas, Trevor-Roper, Beevor, Shirer, Ryan, Toland, Eberle/Uhl, Lehmann/Carroll, O’Donnell, Victor, Petrova/Watson. (Vinogradov hit a snag, reordered). These are books which I have had in my possession and read parts of since Aug 2010. I can understand if others do not have access to the same resources, but I think that should be addressed. If someone does not have access to two footnotes which are critical in a discussion, that also should be addressed...I know that this is P.O.V., and that I am personally involved.

""""Son of Perdition"""" edit=

The concept of the Son of Perdition (also called """"the beast that goes into Perdition"""") is used in the Bible in three contexts, forming a triunism (or """"trinity,"""" or typology) of three potential references.

First frame of reference: Antiochus IV Epiphanes as per the Book of Daniel.

In Revelation, John borrowed the """"Son of Perdition"""" concept from the prophecies of Daniel, relating them by language. He refers to """"the star that fell from heaven"""" by two names, one Greek, and the other Hebrew. The Greek name is """"Appolyon,"""" from the Greek root word """"apolumi."""" It refers to utter loss, eternal destruction, and disassociation."""" The Hebrew name is """"Abaddon,"""" from the Hebrew root word """"'abad,"""" which means the same thing as the Greek root word. In the Book of Daniel, the interpreter says that the eventual destiny of the """"great beast"""" is to be """"destroyed"""" ('abad), and given to the eternal flames (i.e. hell).

Given that many historians, critics, and many Jewish and Christian scholars believe that the Book of Daniel is about the events in Israel from the beginning of the Babylonian Captivity to the end of the Maccabean Revolt, they would say that the reference is to Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the man who attacked the Temple in Jerusalem and defiled it by sacrificing a pig on the altar, erecting a statue of Zeus as himself in the temple, raiding the Temple treasury and minting coins saying """"Theos Epiphanes"""" (God manifest), etc.

Second frame of reference: Judas Iscariot

In John , Jesus says that of all his disciples, none has been lost except the """"son of perdition"""". The New International Version translates the phrase as """"the one doomed to destruction."""" D. A. Carson suggests that this verse refers both to Judas' character and to his destiny.D. A. Carson, The Gospel According to John (Leicester: Apollos, 1991), 563. The phrase is also used in 2 Thessalonians 2:3, where it is equated with the Man of Sin.

Third frame of reference: Some future figure.

In <>, Paulwriting well after both Jesus and Judas had come and gone to their respective destiniesreferred to """"the Son of Perdition"""" in some future sense from the point in time in which he wrote his epistle. Likewise, in Revelation <>, John refers to """"the beast that goeth into perdition, presumably in reference to the same passage in which he equates the Hebrew and Greek names for """"the star that fell from heaven.""""

The following statements are archetypal, and do not reflect every possible variation of belief held by individual religious institution or persons.

Various sects of Jews and Christians, as well as secular historians and critics would acknowledge the use of the phrase """"the Son of Perdition"""" or """"the beast that goes into perdition"""" in one or more of these three frames of reference:

Jewish Reconstructionists and some historians and critics would acknowledge the first frame of reference, as they hold that the book of Daniel is strictly Jewish apocalyptic literature.

Jewish Messianists and Historicists [see Jewish Eschatology], and some historians and critics would acknowledge the first and third frames of reference, but not the second, as they do not believe Jesus is the Messiah.

Christian Historicists, Dispensationalists and Partial Preterists, Messianic Jews, and some historians and critics would acknowledge the second and third frames of reference, as they teach two advents of Jesus Christ. They may also acknowledge the first frame of reference as a typology.

Christian Preterists and Idealists would acknowledge the second frame of reference, and possibly the first frame of reference as a typology, but not the third, as they do not believe in a future fulfillment of prophecy.

A Triunist would recognize all three frames of reference.""",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Films

Hi Nehrams hope your studies are going well and are off on vacation. First have you ever considered some new parameters to the film template -including genre, art direction, casting, second unit director, costume design for example. Also do you think its worth setting up a branch of film WPFilms/Westerns to conentrate on improving western film articles -I know a number of members who would be interested. 

You'll be pleased to know I have created two new templates for film images  these include  Template:Filmrationale  (for screenshots and posters)  and Template:Filmbiorationale (for all deceased film people). I regularly upload many images and it is SOOO! much easier. It has been long awaited and already many users are beginning to use them. For normal bios use Template:Biorationale

I have noticed a crackdown on images to the point that it is seriously affectig our articles, For instance Cinema of the UNited States looks ridiculous with no images. Surely there is even an image of CHarlie Chaplin which is publuic domain? I really hope our images will remain including our main film reel icons which were supposed to be deleted July 1.

I have begun an enormous task of compiling the list of American films in which I have asked the project to help out. Any contribution even if it is adding one or two details particularly 1960-present is really needed.

If you get a moment will you check it out, read it and give your insight/input into my argument.

I only wish I could call it your society).  But I may call Wikipedia your propaganda tool, since you are apparently the one who has been granted authority to tolerate certain comments which you interpret as being unbiased and to crassly delete other information which you interpret as being biased.  If you really want to avoid bias, just casually investigate the history of your pornography supporting friend Horrorshow, who, not surprisingly, has been busy editing other articles that clearly promote the pornography industry.  Wikipedia: a free speech tool for the people or a propaganda tool for a certain sector of the population which seeks to control people's opinions on matters that adversely affect their mental health?  Quite a question to ponder.  But my point on bias is that every author is biased.  Just because Wikipedia can be edited by supposedly anybody (in theory it can be, but in reality it is clearly controlled by certain well-organized individuals who have made Wikipediaing their vocations), does not make Wikipedia an unbiased source of information.  The author of this webpage, who clearly has an interest in displaying information that promotes the pornography industry in the United States, is biased.  His or her comments on Lubben's religious views clearly betray that sentiment, as do the history of his or her activities on Wikipedia.

“""""argument by argument"""" (tm)”?  If you have to invent a fallacy then even you have to know that you’re grasping for straws.

Collect, we do not have to say “the world is regarded as being round by some members of the scientific community” any more than we have to say “water has never definitively been proven to be wet”.  While I would personally prefer that we said something like “Ham’s claims have been disproven by modern science” (because I think it sounds more authoritative), if it’s between “incorrect” or nothing then “incorrect” is clearly the superior choice because it is factually true.

And please don’t try that “all the intelligent readers already know he’s wrong so there’s no need to point out that he’s wrong” argument.  Every fringe-pusher and their uncle has already tried that tactic and it’s bullshit.  We can’t just allow Wikipedia to be full of rubbish and assume that the smart readers will filter the fact from the fiction.  76.107.171.90

About your """"border skirmishes"""" and """"possibility of a ground intervention"""": I never spoke about that. When there already was a Saudi-led invasion taking place, you could not argue the way you are doing anyway. I even did not speak about """"Yemeni Fighters Trained in Persian Gulf"""" or something like that.

Yes """"slowly"""" I got it, that you just don't use the meaning of the term """"military intervention"""" correctly. This term doesn't mean just the operations performed by one side (maybe you are changing Wikipedia encyclopedia with a military gazette?), but it addresses to a form of international conflict. Military intervention is """"Interference by a state in another’s affairs"""" by military means. That means that both - the operations of the intervening powers and the domestic operations are intermingled. Anyway there are domestic reactions to the intervention. And you'll find no historic literature, that tries to separate them, because exactly this is the character of an intervention. Every singly source dealing with the military intervention in Yemen 2015 deals with both, the foreign intervention operation and the existing ground fightings of the domestic conflict.

I thought that bit was the most agreeable part. All kidding aside: People who would lose all respect for someone else based on one outburst deserve no respect themselves in turn (i.e. """"outburst"""" doesn't include going on an RL killling spree or the like of course). I'm still that same guy, sometimes full of shit (includes humor), sometimes with some or even much professional attitude. Maybe I needed it. Maybe not. I like to think that I had to get out some things. And since I'm not the least bit interested in joining WR or another of those places, I had to do it here. And instead of doing it latently, I now got all that out of my system in one outburst. You see, when I usually comment e.g. on what I perceive as a bad-faith RfA oppose, I was constantly holding back, trying to stick to the rules (most of the time anyway). But that sticking to the rules is a rotten """"primary directive"""", and calling spade spade is even more necessary, because it's simply more accurate. And to do it in the form of an alc-induced (or rather, triggered) outburst affords a good option for everyone to ignore the content of what I said, as opposed to constantly complaining about this editor or that comment.

On the other hand: The way things turned out on my initial (very civil, let's not forget that!) posting to AN/I was yet another clear message of how cronyism rules the upper echelons. — Dorftrottel⁠ """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Also, I was going to explain the contents were only as specific as chapter. You have done this in a very neat and clear way, thank you! Great to have you at work on things!
Yes, I thought about linking the books or not. The main argument against was that it took so long to enter them! However, the point of linking every repeated entry in a sortable list imo is that people may sort on city, for example, to see manuscripts near their home, say. If they see that Thessalonians is in a university library 125 miles away, maybe they will click on the link to Thess to see what Wiki editors have said about the book. Instead of looking for the first instance of Thessalonians in the table, or trying to decipher the abbreviation they just click on the field in the record they are looking at.
I agree about not over-Wiki-ing, especially in the body of an article, and especially if different words are given the same link. Tables, by their nature are speedy reference systems, I like the idea of giving people just one click to follow up locating a record of interest.
One example of how I might use the table is to add a """"Textual criticism"""" section to articles on NT books that don't have one already. I'd sort the table by the Contents field (I know it's not perfect), view the data relevant to a book and click through to it.
Another use is to check just what 1 Corinthians chapters 10-11 contain. That article actually has links to specific chapters. Some of us know what's in chapters, most won't. Though, admittedly, not all articles on NT books go to specifics on chapters, but maybe in time they will.
Now the work is done, it seems like a pity to lose it. Rest assured, I'm not going to be writing articles with every second word Wikified. ;)  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Ethnic Violence
I think the following paragraph should be removed from the article -

It has been suggested that the random violence was a delayed response to crime perpetrated by other middle easterners, such as gang rapes that occured in 2000 and 2002.

My main problem with it is that the claim being put forward is totally unsourced and unsupported. Yes, whoever put it in has provided an article from the Australian as a source. However, if you actually read this article, it doesn't say anything of the sort about the violence being some kind of delayed response to events in 2000 and 2002. In fact, it only mentions rape once. Here is the relevant section of the article -

In an article on this page nearly two years ago (""""Don't turn a blind eye to terror in our midst,"""" January 12, 2004), I argued that the increasing frequency of racially motivated attacks on young Australian men and women - including murders, gang rapes and serious assaults by young men of Lebanese Muslim descent - would rise dramatically throughout Australia. These problems remain widespread and have been documented in the ensuing two years.

 Been a while. 

Happy belated: birthday, Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, and Groundhog Day.

Take a break from all the WP nannying. Hope you're doing great @ MIT.

Take another look at December 2008’s and last month’s archived portal pages and see if they work correctly on your end. Shades of Extreme Home Makeover - etc.

This may be the closest I get to re-mastering old films, like they now have to do for Blu-Ray. Feels like it, fun but tedious.

Some of these archived portal pages I've trundled through going back to Jan of '08 (so far) succumb to table-formatting bugs (on my platform [Tiger/Safari (+FF3)]). So I kludged the position of the calendars. But these two months work fine. No clue as to why they break. Is there a documented bug? This seems to be some kind of CSS error.

The Portal:Current events/How to archive the portal page must not be visited very often of late, so I'm attempting to make its link more prominent by adding a comment above the """"fold"""". Don't have a clue how many editors might contribute to the upkeep of this, though.

Here are handy linx for you to peruse these pages, only the last 2 have reconstructed sidebars As Of This Writing (hereinafter """"AOTW""""):

January 2008 (works okay on my plat)

February 2008 (broken, so it's kludged)

March 2008 (okay)

April 2008 (okay)

May 2008 (works okay, International hols are an embarrassment [why just May?])

June 2008 (works OK)

July 2008 (breaks with prescribed table formatting, so it's kludged)

August 2008 (OK)

September 2008 (OK)

October 2008 (OK)

November 2008 (also breaks so it's kludged. Don't know what'll happen if we attempt to reconstruct & restore a local [temporally speaking ;)] sidebar)

December 2008 (Okay and complete, with the important comment that it's an archived section)

January 2009 (Also OK, as above)

So pass the word along that some spadework has been done, and it's as self-explanatory as I can manage to make it. Thanx again for all the great work on this design, unjustly neglected.

WikiProject Poland Newsletter • January 2014 • Issue IIFor our freedom and yours

Welcome to the second issue of WikiProject Poland newsletter, the Monitor (named after the first Polish newspaper).

Our Project has been operational since 1 June, 2005, and also serves as the Poland-related Wikipedia notice board. I highly recommend watchlisting the Wikipedia:WikiProject Poland page, so you can be aware of the ongoing discussions. We hope you will join us in them, if you haven't done so already! Unlike many other WikiProjects, we are quite active; we get close to a hundred discussion threads each year and we do a pretty good job at answering all issues raised. Last year we were featured in the Signpost, and our interviewer was amazed at our activity. In the end, however, even as active as we are, we are just a tiny group - you can easily become one of our core members!

In addition to a lively encyclopedic, Poland-related, English-language discussion forum, we have numerous useful tools that can be of use to you - and that you could help us maintain and develop:
 we have an active assessment department. As of now, our project has tagged almost 83,000 pages as Poland-related - that's an improvement of over 3,000 new pages since the last newsletter. Out of which 30 still need a quality assessment, and 2,000, importance assessment. We have done a lot to clear the backlog here (3 years ago those numbers were 1,500 and 20,000, respectively). Can you help assess a few pages?
assessing articles is as easy as filling in the class= and importance= parameters on the talk page in the {{WPPOLAND|class=|importance=}} template. See here for a how-to guide.
 once an article has an assessment template, it will appear in our article alerts and news feed, which provides information on which Poland-related articles are considered for deletion, move, or are undergoing a Good or Featured review. Watchlisting that feed, in addition to watchlisting our project's main page, is a good way to make sure you stay up to date on most Poland-related discussions.
 you can also see detailed deletion discussions at Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletion sorting/Poland (which is a good place to watchlist if you just want to stay up to date on possible deletions of Poland-related content)
 we have also begun B-class quality reviews on our talk page, and if our activity increases, hopefully we will be able to institute our own A-class quality reviews. As of now, we have about 500 C-class articles in need of a B-class review. If you'd like to help with them, instructions for doing B-class reviews are to be found in point 10 of our assessment FAQ.

When you found out about who I was, you teased me, insulted me behind my back and through e-mail, etc., etc., which is why I have become so angered with the community. Is this really necessary? Yes, you are certainly allowed to do whatever you want but some comments just pushed my buttons, which is why from time to time I exhibited infinite and random stupidity. Of course I am going to admit this — because I did. No, an arbitration will not be necessary because I am leaving the second We Belong Together finishes FAC and this is not a lie. Will I return? Maybe. I am not going to be present throughout late June–late September (I'll be studying elsewhere in the world). Therefore, I will not be making edits on Wikipedia during this time. However, following September, I might come back. Just do me this one favour: if you find out who I am (if I return), please don't tease me and do the things you have done; that was why I became uncivil and angered. Again, if you find out, just leave me to be and we wouldn't have to get caught up in such a fiasco. I really do wish you well. Seriously.
My only complaint is that HeyNow10029 is whining because she knows that I was right about the images in the Kelly Clarkson article.

Unfortunately politics has interfered in my recent edits on Northern Cyprus. As a Turkish Cypriot I have volunteered my time to improve and expand the article on Northern Cyprus with my sources been taken from websites based in Northern Cyprus. Some of the information I added was changed around and improved in a way so in which it can be understood. If you could compare the information with the original it is quite different with some sections using different wording and such. I was ready to negotiate with Dr.K and was even prepared to alter the section into my own words. But unfortunately it wasn't enough. The dispute initially started with GiorgosY who is now banned from editing. Many attempts to vandalize the page where made by this specific user over the past few weeks. Attempts to delete, blank, and vandalize the page was also made by various other users disagreeing with factual well sourced information which has been taken from archives and books written by professional historians.

There is no such source and the poll is certainly one of those sources that I am unable to use. HOWEVER, if instead, I read the policy and apply the evidence to the policy, the question comes up: """"Is it disputed?"""".  The poll indicates that it is disputed.  That is how the information in the poll is used.  It is completely inadequate to determine if, in fact, waterboarding is torture, or if wikipedia should say one thing or the other. But it is NOT inadequate to determining if there is a dispute, which is a key means of checking for NPOV.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

 Please respect others' copyrights; do not copy and paste the contents from webpages directly.
 Please use a neutral point of view when editing articles; this is possibly the most important Wikipedia policy.
 If you are testing, please use the Sandbox to do so. 
 Do not add unreasonable contents into any articles, such as: copyrighted text, advertisement messages, and text that is not related to an article's subject. Adding such unreasonable information or otherwise editing articles maliciously is considered vandalism, and will result in your account being blocked.

The Wikipedia Tutorial is a good place to start learning about Wikipedia. If you have any questions, see the help pages, add a question to the village pump or ask me on  my talk page.

 A brief biography of fourth Chokhor Tenzin Chogyal 

Chokhor Rinpoche was born to father Kalsang Dorjee and mother Kalsang Chokey on 20th Oct, 1979 (the day was on auspicious day of Dipawali) in Kalimpong, the hill station of West Bengal, North East state of India. 

While Ripoche’s mother was pregnant, there were so many auspicious signs showed to her. She often dreamt of a white rabbit sleeping on her lap; thousand of twinkling stars entering to her womb and became different jewels. She also often dreamt a huge and well built guy with fire on his body almost look like Vajrapani was appeared and talked to her without any frightening. She also dreamt a white clothed young guy came and told her to go with him on riding dragon and hovered in the sky several times. And often that guy comes in her dream and told to keep that white rabbit and feed well. On the forth night of Rinpoche’s birthday, she dreamt same. After gave birth of of Rinpoche, Dhardo Rinpoche named him “Lhundub”.

After a year, the little Lhundub used to do pray in front of the photo of His Holiness with the decoration different fruits as offering. He also used to sit on piled pillows and saying he is Lama and take his blessing, to his relative children. Moreover, the little boy was happy to visit monastery and meet monks.

When the little boy was on four years old, he often told his dream to his parent that he dreamt of a lord of charnel grounds [having the form of a skeleton] telling him that your home is not a place of long term living, you need to go far distance where there is huge temple, and you should go with two person who would come to invite you. Rinpoche still remember that dream he told to his mother several times.

In the beginning of year 1983, the little boy started to go English School in Kalimpong. In the winter of that year, the boy Rinpoche and his parents and grandparents visited to Bodhagaya, where he got the full discourse of Shantideva’s Bodhisatvacharyavatara from His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama. While in Bodhgaya, Rinpoche’s parents were visited Pangnang Rinpoche whom they asked soothing of little boy’s well beings. Pangnang Rinpoche, after drawing of dice for soothing told that nothing to worry and added name “Tsondue” after his name “Lhundup”. There after the little boy was called “Lhundub Tsondue”.

While little boy, Lhundub Tsondue was on his routine to Nursery school, on 21st March, 1985, he was recognized as the unmistaken reincarnation of 3rd Chokhor Rinpoche by His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama. After two years later his admittance to Lhopa Khangtsen in Sera Jey Monastic University in south India, the eight-year-old Lhundub Tsondue was invited by Geshe Jampa Topgyal and Geshe Gyaltsen of Lhopa Khangtsen in 1986. The first hair cutting ceremony was taken by Sera Jey Khensur Ngawang Legden and given name as “Ngawang Choekyi Gyaltsen” and admitted to the monastery.

Few days after his admission to the monastery, Geshe Jampa Topgyal taught few alphabets to read as dependent-arising. Then Geshe Gyaltsen took Rinpoche to consult Geshe Ngawang Choesang of Tsangpa Khangtsen as a teacher. On Geshe Ngawang la’s guidance of long fifteen years, Rinpoche learned from the beginning of reading and writing, Tibetan Calligraphy, Sumchupa and Tagjug, Tibetan literature. During the consultation of Geshe Ngawang la, Rinpoche memorized all daily prayers and the root text of (Abhisamaya Alamkara, Madhyamikavatara, Abhi Dharma Khosh).Recited hundred thousand of “Tendrel Toepa”,(Praise of Dependent Arising, by Tsongkhapa). While consulting Geshe Ngawang Choesang, Rinpoche also went to Sera Je Secondary School for five years. 

In 1988, during the Lamrim teaching by His Holiness the Dalai Lama, Chokhor Rinpoche got the first privately audience with His Holiness the Dalai Lama at Drepung monastery. His Holiness gave him name “Tenzin Chogyal“.

In 1992, Chokhor Rinpoche left the academic studies and joined the monastic education with consultation of Gyume Khensur Lobsang Delek as teacher. In 1994, Rinpoche took novice vow from His Eminence Choden Rinpoche and added name “Palsangpo” after “Tenzin Chogyal” as novice name.

As the rule and regulation of the monastery, in 1996, 25th day of 6th month Rinpoche was stood on the Rigchung ceremony in the congregation of Sera Jey monks, everyone was surprised with his under/over tone of explanation with melancholic tune and answering of debate opponent.

While studying the fundamental philosophy in the monastery, on the two month vacation, Chokhor Rinpoche used to accomplish the recitation of Mig-tsema and some vocation took complete retreat on Yamantaka and had its burnt sacrifices. In 1999 Rinpoche was invited to Italy by his sponsor during the vacation, Rinpoche taught and gave lecture on Tibetan issue to Italian",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Oversourcing
Hi, I thought I should explain why I reverted the edit you made to Warwick Castle, especially considering it takes a lot less effort to hit the revert button than it does to go through and prune references. I understand that you were consolidating references since just one is used for most paragraphs. However, per WP:V """"material challenged or likely to be challenged, and all quotations, must be attributed"""". Therefore I think it's better to have a generous amount rather than just one per paragraph. Moreover, if someone was to add information to the article from another source it could wrongly appear that all the information in the paragraph before the reference comes from the new source (unless of course the editor was careful to duplicate sources). So I am sorry to revert your changes, but I am quite happy to discuss it if you still believe the references should be trimmed.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

The problem we have at the moment is that the entire section needs sourcingand while I have sources for some of it, many of these are not sources I will link to in a wiki article.  The alumni sites for example are run very well and would certainly meet sourcing requirements, but also have individuals personal information on them and I'm strongly against linking to those as sources, especially as the new website does not provide links to the alumni pages, but let's alumni voluntarily provide information about themselves.
I had planned to go up the school at somepoint soon and use the library copies of old yearbooks and check and cite thoseI also think that the school does have alumni information, I'm just wrong about where it is kept.

Fusion-Mutiny

The Fusion and Mutiny played more games than are listed on this page.  Their rivalry lasted from 1998-2001.   

 Rowdies vs Miami Toros? 

Any thought to expanding this rivalry to include its pre-history, the 1975 and 1976 NASL Seasons when the Rowdies played against the Miami Toros, who would become the the Strikers? If we are including MLS matches, this notion would also seem logical to me. Cheers to all! -  

Original research
I know there's been a lot of earnest work here, but the premise appears to be entirely original research. It combines information and scores for every team from the two metropolitan areas, whether there was any real connection or not. The original Tampa Bay Rowdies were not related to the Tampa Bay Mutiny or the modern Tampa Bay Rowdies/FC Tampa Bay. The original Fort Lauderdale Strikers/Miami Toros were not related to the second Fort Lauderdale Strikers, the Miami Fusion, or the third Fort Lauderdale Strikers/Miami FC. And of course several of those were named for or played in Miami rather than Fort Lauderdale. I doubt that any source outside of Wikipedia has ever pulled them all together like this. Most of the sources used here are either self-published blogs, or they just give information on individual teams or games; they don't make a claim about an overall rivalry lasting since the 1970s. Unfortunately, this article may need a total reshifting in focus to keep it. t/c 

Allow me to address your areas of concern about this page:

THE EARLY YEARS: 1975–1993: Perhaps you did NOT read the newspaper accounts cited in this page of the very first meeting between the original clubs in 1975? Four minutes into the match and the players began to brawl! Yup, no rivalry, that. The Toros moved to Ft. Lauderdale in 1977, so from 1975–83, it was always the same two teams playing. The original Rowdies lasted until 1993 and all of the subsequent Striker teams in that era had numerous NASL-era Strikers playing for them. That is part of what carried the rivalry on during those lean ASL/APSL years. The other cited references span the years right up to the two franchises that play under the names Rowdies and Strikers in the NASL of today. Many were published by the local media in the two markets, some were done by the MLS and some by the new NASL. Are these not varied and reliable enough for your tastes? Or are you suggesting that every single article on the rivalry topic over the past 38 years needs to be cited to prove a rivalry existed and continues to exist? 

BLOGS AS A SOURCE: A quick count of the sourcing shows 37 of the 91 cited sources are from blogs, etc. Even by the broadest of definitions (i.e. 50% + 1), this is not """"most of the sources"""" as you state. It would be more accurate to say many of those blog citations are used only to verify final scores or attendance figures. Again are you suggesting that every np article on every match be unearthed to confirm the scores? Until the USSF sees fit to publish the recap of every sanctioned match in US history online, resources will remain a hodge-podge. Nearly all of the narrative of the page in question is supported by information published by reliable media outlets. Closer examination will further show that even some of the blog sourced material happens to be previously published np photos and/or articles that were scanned and posted in the blogs.

MLS era: In the MLS years, the Mutiny had several former Rowdies working in their front office staff, one of whom, by the way now happen to work for the current Rowdies. Both they and the Fusion had former NASL-era Rowdies and Strikers as their head coaches at one time or another. The Miami Ultras were originally the Fusion's supporters. They now follow the Strikers. The connections were always there. As a matter of fact, inclusion of the Mutiny/Fusion era",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

 Proper use 

The adjustable spanner#Proper use section of this article still seems to be self-contradictory.

I found one discussion  that has some physics-based arguments that I found pretty persuasive.
One commenter says that the preferred way to use a pipe wrench is the opposite direction from the preferred way to use an adjustable wrench,
which may explain why so many people disagree on the """"proper"""" direction to turn it.

Norm Abram, in """"Adjustable Wrench"""",
implies that (unlike a basin wrench) an adjustable wrench often works adequately even when turned the """"wrong way"""", such as when doing the """"flip trick"""".
This may also contribute to why so many people disagree on the """"proper"""" direction to turn it.

What exactly is the advantage of turning it the """"right"""" way versus the """"wrong"""" way?
Too often I hear that turning it the """"wrong"""" way is """"more likely to round off the corners"""" without any more details,
but I prefer an explanation that would make it possible to work out from first principles which way is the """"right"""" way.

I'll go ahead and do the page move.  I'll probably wait till tomorrow my Internet time is drawing to a close, and since I haven't done hatnotes very often, I'll want some time to read up on them and correct any mistakes that I make.

Regarding references, I don't think you need to include a citation after every sentence, as long as they're not direct or indirect quotes, and/or potentially controversial in any way.  This is especially true if a whole paragraph comes from a single source in that case, I just put a single citation marker at the end of the paragraph.  If I use multiple sources in a paragraph, but I don't quote anybody or include anything that might come into dispute, I usually stick a string of citations at the end of the paragraph.  To me, that makes the text a little more readable.

Also regarding citations, you can save yourself a few keystrokes on repeated citations where you're using a name.  Once you've created a citation with a name, you don't have to type """"""""; you can just use """""""", with the slash at the end of the tag.  That'll give you a tiny bit less keyboarding to do, and it also makes it a little easier to edit when there's a string of citations less risk of losing the closing """""""" tag.  I've done this with the Lt. Cherry article, if you'd like to check it out.

If you want to get a little fancier, I like to use list-defined references, which is what I did with Lt. Cherry's article.  Basically, that involves putting the citation information inside the {{Reflist}} in the references section.  That way, it doesn't get eliminated by accident if somebody edits out a passage including citation information and doesn't check the edit summary to make sure that they're not orphaning a """""""" tag.  It's also easier to read the text in the edit window if you don't have to wade through tangles of citation details.

By the """"Ft. Table"""", did you mean the boxed business in the upper right?  In Wikiparlance, that's known as an infobox, and you put them in using templates.  The one you'd probably want to use for Ft. Niobrara is Template:Infobox military installation.  If you'll follow that Wikilink, you can see how it works.  You don't have to fill in all the parameters on an infobox if some of them aren't applicable or if you don't have the information, you can leave them blank.

Good luck with the Ft. N. article; leave me a note if I can be of help.  I'll keep it on my watchlist and render what assistance I can.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Hi, good day.

My deepest apologies that I had made the change.
I had made the change it was because I was there. On the day.
I was there on the day when they are all line up the most straightest one straight line,

when the clock strikes 12 exactly at the noon on that day. (The date which I provided).
It was the most beautiful thing I ever see.
I know many thing need prove but I know what I saw that day. It is up to you now

Patrick Walsh on the role of """"extreme rightwing"""" Agent-Provocateurs
As documented by the former Royal Canadian Mounted Police undercover agent, Mr. Patrick Walsh, in a recently published book in Canada, """"The Unholy Alliance"""", Zionists have played a major role in promoting """"Nazi"""" and other allegedly anti-Jewish movement. The much publicised """"Nazi"""" leader Lincoln Rockwell was a creature of the Zionist terror machine, and played a major role in persuading rich American Jews that they should contribute to the Zionists, who would protect them from threatened """"anti-Semitism"""". Patrick Walsh thoroughly exposes the role of the agent provocateur. The Walsh exposures have, according to Canadian reports, thrown the Zionists and their dupes into some confusion. 

Patrick Walsh would have been most interested to hear Andrew Campbell's strong objection to a recent reference to """"Zionist thuggery"""". He was the victim of this thuggery when brutally attacked by a group of Jewish Defence League members outside a room in the Royal York Hotel, Toronto, who were attempting to break up a school being conducted by Eric Butler. Zionist thuggery has been used against lawful patriotic groups right around the world. The League of Rights has constantly warned against extending encouragement to any type of violence, stressing that evil policies can be defeated through the British system of constitutional government.

 User:Varsovian 

Instead of keeping a low profile for awhile he immediately inserted himself into a discussion on WikiProject about the Nazi collaborator Anthony Sawoniuk. The nationality of Anthony Sawoniuk is yet determined, the only source which says his mother was Polish is a newspaper article. In a provocative style Varsovian started to compare the Nazi collaborator and war criminal Sawoniuk with Frederic Chopin(!).  """"That makes him more Polish than Chopin!"""", """"If Sawoniuk isn't Polish, neither is Chopin"""". I have asked him what has Chopin to do with Sawoniuk and reply was this:  """"if he isn't Polish, neither is Chopin"""", """"Unless we can find a source which says that Sawoniuk's father was a nationality other than Polish, Sawoniuk is purely Polish"""". This is crazy, he should provide sources that Sawoniuk and his father is Polish not others that he is not. Not happy enough that he needlessly dragged Chopin's name into the discuss on a Nazi collaborator, he opened a new section titled Chopin vs Sawoniuk. . I asked him to provide sources:  and the reply was this:  no sources provided and more comparisons between F.Chopin and Sawoniuk. He also accused me that I am """"trying to distract attention from yet another warning you this week received despite being under a DIRWIGEN official caution"""". I am most certainly not trying to distract attention from anything but I have a problem when somebody compares a Nazi collaborator of uncertain nationality with Frederic Chopin. I request you review if Varsovian's conduct is not in violation of the standards expected in the EE area.

 You should wait for others to write an article about subjects in which you are personally involved. This applies to articles about you, your achievements, your band, your business, your publications, your website, your relatives, and any other possible conflict of interest. 

Creating an article about yourself is strongly discouraged. If you create such an article, it might be listed on articles for deletion. Deletion is not certain, but many feel strongly that you should not start articles about yourself.

All edits to articles must conform to Wikipedia:No original research, Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, and Wikipedia:Verifiability. 

If you are not """"notable"""" under Wikipedia guidelines, creating an article about yourself may violate the policy that Wikipedia is not a personal webspace provider and would thus qualify for speedy deletion.

Your substitute is not adequate, either: therefore, it is asserted by some critics that socialistic is less individualistic.

A major advance of this assessment of climate change projections compared with the TAR is the large number of simulations available from a broader range of models. Taken together with additional information from observations, these provide a quantitative basis for estimating likelihoods for many aspects of future climate change. Model simulations cover a range of possible futures including idealised emission or concentration assumptions.

 Comment from Homosexuality (workspace) 

Actually, my citation can be the very same 2000 Breedlove study that our friend in Farmington includes in Fetal hormones and sexual orientation. Background is that length of ring finger relative to index finger is strongly correlated with fetal testosterone levels. That fact is rather well established quite apart from sexual orientation. Breedlove found an additional much weaker correlation between implied fetal testosterone and sexual orientation, with lesbians in particularly being most strongly androgynized. It's definitely interesting. Gay men show the same pattern (gays more androgynized), but to a smaller degree.

However, there is a huge overlap between the suggested fetal testosterone levels and sexual orientation. That is, on average of a bunch of lesbians had higher fetal testosterone than a paired group of straight women. But many lesbians had lower fetal testosterone than the straight-woman average. And many straight women had higher fetal testosterone than the lesbian average. The standard deviation within each group is much more than the mean difference between the groups.

So what does it show? Well, I dunno. There's something potentially interesting there, especially if it can be replicated in much larger samples. But it's hardly clear causation, nor even clear correlation. What it amounts to might be something like (purely hypothetically): """"High testesterone exposure female fetuses have a 10% chance of becoming lesbian; low testosterone exposure female fetuses have a 5% chance of becoming lesbian."""" But that's about the strongest conclusion I can imagine coming out of this (and it hasn't yet, it's been suggested), and that's a relatively weak factor.

Another misconception is the origin of the Vic-20.  The real creator of the concept was Jim Kennedy who was the Commodore engineering manager after Chuck Peddle left in August, 1978 to work at Apple. Jack Tramiel asked him to visit MOS and he talked to Bob Yannes where he got the specs for the VIC chip.  He and I discussed a prototype VIC-20  but unfortunately Kennedy was canned in February 1980 when CHuck was re-hired by Commodore.

The Objectivity of this Discussion is doubtful (non-existent)

(1) As indicated earlier, the section on Marxist leaders’ views is misleading:

(a) it lays unwarranted and excessive emphasis on Trotsky, creating the misleading impression that other prominent Marxists (Marx, Engels, Lenin) did not advocate and/or practiced terrorism;

(b) it lays unwarranted and excessive emphasis on the theoretical “rejection of individual terrorism”, creating the misleading impression that this is the main (only) Marxist position on terrorism. 

(2) The discussion is not being properly monitored:

(a) no discernible attempt is being made to establish and maintain an acceptable degree of objectivity;

(b) important and relevant scholarly works such as the International Encyclopedia of Terrorism are being ignored or illicitly excluded from the discussion;

(c) though the only logical way to remedy the blatant imbalance in the above section is to include quotes by/on other leaders who are known to have endorsed and practiced terrorism all attempts to do so have been systematically blocked with impunity by the apologists for Marxist terrorism who have done their best to sabotage and wreck both the article and the discussion.

(3) Among the tactics deployed by the apologist wreckers and saboteurs the following may be identified as representative examples:

(a) it is claimed that Marx and Engels did not advocate terrorism despite the fact that scholarly works like the International Encyclopedia of Terrorism show that they did, and Marx himself was known as “The Red Terror Doctor”;

(b) it is claimed that Marx and Engels were not involved in terrorist activities despite the fact that numerous sources from The Neue Rheinische Zeitung to Isaiah Berlin and Francis Wheen state otherwise;

(c) it is claimed that Lenin does not refer to terror in The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade K. Kautsky and other works/statements despite the fact that Robert Service, IET, and other scholarly and reliable sources state that he does;

(d) it is claimed that the Russian word ‘’strakh’’ does not mean “terror” when:

i. the Oxford Russian Dictionary says that it does;

ii. it is evident from the context that this is the case;

iii. any educated Russian speaker can confirm that strakh may mean “terror” depending on the context;

(e) it is claimed that Marxism is “scientific” when in fact:

i. Marx was not a scientist;

ii. Marx’s background was philosophy and law, not science;

iii. Marxism is not recognized as a science by the academic world;

iv. virtually every one of Marx’s predictions turned out to be wrong, as became increasingly apparent during his lifetime and incontrovertibly so after his death (R. Pipes, Communism: A Brief History, 2001, p. 15) from which it follows that Marxism does not qualify as a scientific system by any accepted standards;

v. the evidence indicates that Marxism is closer to a religious sect than to science proper;

(f) apologist literature is being quoted in a fraudulent attempt to whitewash Marxist terrorism, in effect turning the discussion into an advertisement for terrorism;

(g) it is claimed that Marxist terrorism is not rooted in the Marxist theory of class struggle even though there are numerous sources showing that it is (please note that it is immaterial whether terrorism had already been justified in terms of a theory of class prior to Marx, the point being that it was advocated/practiced on the basis of Marxist class-struggle theories BY MARXISTS):

“Karl Marx felt that terror was a necessary part of a revolutionary strategy” (Peter Galvert, “Theories of Terror in Urban Insurrections”, IET, p. 138);

“Revolutionary terrorism has its roots in a political ideology, from the Marxist-Leninist thinking of the Left, to the fascists found on the Right” (Noemi Gal-Or, """"Revolutionary Terrorism"""", IET, p. 203);

“… perhaps the most important key to Stalin’s motivation lies in the realm of ideology. The leitmotif of Soviet communist ideology in the 1920s and 1930s was class struggle – the inbuilt antagonism between mutually incompatible economic interest groups” (Geoffrey Robert, Stalins Wars, 2006, pp. 17-18);

this fact is supported not only by reliable academic sources, but by elementary logic: 

“In 1907 Mehring published in the magazine ‘’Neue Zeit (Vol. XXV 2, p. 164) extracts from a letter by Marx to Weydemeyer dated March 5, 1852. In this letter, among other things, is the following noteworthy observation: … class struggle necessarily leads to the dictatorship of the proletariat …”",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Perhaps the """"self-advertising"""" character of this article would be somewhat abrogated by a little criticism.  In this article http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/a-defence-force-of-terminators-is-almost-here-20090510-az6u.html?page=2 he writes: 

""""Remember, one of the rules when it comes to technology is Moore's law, that the computing power that can fit on a microchip doubles just under every two years. If this trend holds true, as it has for the past several decades, Australia's Force 2030 will be operating in a world in which our information technology will be a billion times more powerful than today. Notably, this isn't an amorphous """"billion"""", as Dr Evil would pontificate in the movie Austin Powers, but literally taking the power of our current computers multiplying it by 1,000,000,000. But imagine if that law doesn't hold true, and Moore's Law works out at only a hundredth of its past pace. Then the computers that power robots in the era of Force 2030 will only be a mere 1,000,000 times more powerful.""""

Ironically, his grasp of numeric quantities is probably even further off than Dr. Evil's.  If """"computing power"""" doubles every two years for twenty years, the resulting increase in computing power would be just 1024 times more powerful (2^10 = 1024 see http://www.google.com/search?q=2^10&ie;=utf-8&oe;=utf-8&aq;=t), not """"a billion"""".  And if computing power increased at 1/100th of its current pace (i.e. instead of doubling, increasing at one-one-hundredth of 2 = 0.02 per annum), the resulting increase in power would be just 1.02^10: computers would be 1.21899442 times as powerful as those today.

All this would probably be more relevant if he even managed to get Moore's Law correct in the first place.  Moore's Law did not relate to """"computing power"""" but to the density of transistors in a given area.  In practical terms, a doubling of the number of transistors /= doubling of computing power... so we CERTAINLY aren't going to facing armies of Terminators, a """"billion"""" times more computationally powerful than the robots of today!!!

Dear MisfitToys,

My name is Jonathan Obar user:Jaobar, I'm a professor in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences at Michigan State University and a Teaching Fellow with the Wikimedia Foundation's Education Program. This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the communityHERE, where it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students.

So a few things about the interviews:
 Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes.
 Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.)
 All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so.
 All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time.
 The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly.

Bottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name instead.

If you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu. I will be more than happy to speak with you.

Thanks in advance for your help. We have a lot to learn from you.

You took some mesures who are unlikely to be the right ones in that case, and it will crave a certain degree of familiarity with the subject and its history to can handle the task properly.
Do not dismiss users with longer experience with the case as it was based on this experience that the talk page was brought out. For instance, I received mails from the person who wrote the biography of the affair both for the french and the english talk page, as those din't knew enough about the matter to start with.
If I were you, I will feel suspicious of receiving approuval and encouragemets about what you are doing, from a person who first heard about this affair for 3 weeks ago, second: heard about it from ybm -the drive force of this affair and person who resurected it from ashes in nov. 2003 - so not much reliable as an eye opener and arbitrary source of informations, and third: who has conducted, since then, a revert war in the best anti-3RR rules, and best ybm styles...

It isn't right for an admi to emit subjectiv and judgementals accusations toward users, as calling them socket puppet and other insulting terminology, as it is usually to be found in the mouth of the persons who in shortage of argumentation, choose to attack people personnaly in best sophistics style.
So no surprise that the person who rever you is the same one who used that language constantly against other users before you stepped in, and who was also doing the reverting job as you are doing it now.

It is abusively unclear, what you are trying to do, and I do hope that a more adequate person will take over the surveillance of this talk page. One with the right degree of integrity, the proper knowledge of the stuff, here physic, a thourough insight in the affair and its history, and a knowledge of the people involved and their characters and profile in regard to the topic.
I think here of Nicholas Turnbull, administrator, and expert in mediation.

I have, unfortunately, to aknowledge the fact that your latest actions have resulted in creating a turmoil on the site, based both on your actions and your utterings, and that you have provocated 50% of the users, who had already been harshly provocated by user r-b-j for several weeks and needed therefor the administrators help to put an end to it, not to overtake the place of the source of turmoils.

I do believe that you are acting your best with your actual knowledge of the facts, but nonetheless you should be more carefull to don't bruise som ego by commiting unfully justified and unjust actions in the process, and as a consequence endanger the quality of the talk page.

As those arguments for and against have been dancing in parallel for far too long time, without everreaching a solid ground of agreement, and as references made by anti bogdanov are always pointed at some unclear statement made by scientifics a long time ago, where most did redraw it, and as all those people of science didn't knew a thing about Theoretical Physic and/or Cosmologie, which this dispute is about, and as the positiv statements, made by specialists in the fields named above, are systematically unaccepted for tricky reasons, as are the statements made on this page by pro-bogdanovian, who are called socket puppets for a yes or for a no, I suggest this affair to be settled once and for all by truly and undiscustably specialists in that field, I named Holger Beck Nielsen professor of the Copenhague Niels Bohr Institut of Theoretical Physic, and Stephen W. Hawking, from the Chair of Mathematic of Cambridge University.

I have already made the necessary steps in order to bring professor Holger Beck Nielsen attention to that matter, and would like to know if anyone feel of doing the same in England.
I tried already to suggest this approach above, but it seems that my suggestion was drawned in the tumults of the fights and remained ignored.
I will ask you to make a join effort to gather your attention on this particular possibility and think of how each of you can take part in its fullfillment, in the best interest of all parts involved.

Response to help desk

Hi Rockingchick. Sorry your article was deleted, but it sounds like you were writing a biography of a non-notable person. We can't generally let people write articles about people they know or knew personally because it violates our policies of having everything verified by reliable sources (if you write about someone the wider world hasn't heard of we have no way of making sure what you wrote is true) and writing from a neutral point of view (you can't be neutral about someone you know personally). There are more specific guidelines as to who's considered notable at WP:BIO.

If you'd like some ideas for a good first article, you can try the Your first article (which is more a list of """"don't""""s) and the Requested articles pages. The community portal also has lots of other ways in which people can contribute to Wikipedia apart from writing new articles.

My two main suggestions are to make smaller improvements to the article and to use more than one source. Unless you are very skilled at proper paraphrasing, using a single source greatly increases the risk of close paraphrasing, i.e. improper paraphrasing, and also leads to a very one-sided view of the subject. I've added two reference to the article with links to their pages on Google books (most of which are visible, at least in the UK). The print copies may also be in the Longy library:
Marco, Tomás (1993). Spanish Music in the Twentieth Century. 
Draayer, Suzanne Rhodes (2009). Art Song Composers of Spain: An Encyclopedia
The previous reference I had added—Romero, Justo (2004). Liner Notes: Joaquín Turina (1882–1949): Piano Music, Vol. 1—is also very useful, especially for discussing his musical style and works chronology. I suggest you use these as your sources for further expansion with the biography on joaquinturina.com] as a back-up only.
 
One thing you could do is separate out the last paragraph (beginning with """"His works include..."""") with its own heading Music and expand the commentary there. For example, he was a very noted composer of art song, which is given short shrift in the article. Much has been written about his approach to incorporating Spanish musical idiom in his work and on his style in general, including its strengths and weaknesses. This is also lacking in the article.
 
Another possibility, is to separate out a section at the beginning of biography to Early years where you discuss his family background and his musical education prior to Paris. The material between that section and Music could be entitled Paris and Madrid and can always be expanded in the future.
 
A third possibility is to expand and rationalize the list of works in the article. The current one has three major problems. First, it excludes many of his important works because it relies solely on those scores available at IMSLP. Secondly, it gives no indication of each work's type. Thirdly, it gives no indication of the date of their composition. Listing them alphabetically, is not a good way to go. If you do decide to concentrate on improving the works list, I suggest using List of compositions by Claude Debussy by genre as a model, although in this case, the list would not be a separate article, but rather continue to appear in the Selected works section of Joaquín Turina.
 
Hope that helps. Best,   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Destructuring of the article
Ladies and gentlemen, apart from painful neutrality issue, I'm concerned with the growing deformation of the article's structure and style. I'm talking mainly about the actions of the definite national group of editors (which I could avoid naming unless it renews its usual personal attacking again).

Two weeks ago I removed the duplicating and excessicely-detailed sentences, as well as irrelevant images from """"Ukraine"""" section, and the other side seemed to agree non-images edit. Now I find new duplicating passages in the first section (although the intro looks better now). Editors who responsible for this: did you care reading section in the whole? And more, new lenghty redundant subsection on Vitebsk appeared. Not to mention the images, which litter only """"Ukraine"""" section (is this a permanent trollish attack on Ukrainian editors?).

Why doing things like that? I can understand POV-pushing intentions of pro-partisans users... But we must first of all care about innocent readers, not concerned with survival of either Russia or Ukraine. Otherwise the project would degrade, and Jimbo would run out of his budget.

 Ataturk and Kurds 

AW, the article is about Ataturks life in a factual historical context. It is about the things he had done in his life. Not about what Kurds think of him.

Let's take Coca-Cola for example, a completely benign subject. If someone said """"Pepsi lover's critique Coke for being too acidic"""" (source:Pepsi lovers magazine)"""" would you consider that part of the history of Coke or part of the history of Pepsi lovers? It certainly is an opinion, that could only be the history of a Pepsi lover because Coke has nothing to with their taste or aspirations of how a cola should be. (sorry for the silly analogy but you get the point I hope). Furthermore, this maybe a fact (it's a fact that someone had this critique of coke), but it's not an historical event, a historical fact, nor is it NPOV. 

Now if you apply this to Kurdish """"criticizms"""", then you would get the same outcome. It's all a matter of taste. And there a millions critiques of Ataturks out there, some being offensive to Kurds. Shall we include those as well?

Not to mention, which Kurds criticized? When did they do this? How many are there? What are their credentials? So you also have a credibility problem here.

Moreover, your sources can't possibly speak for all Kurds. I would be surprised if you could dispute that FACT.

I think these are all the places that have any claim of being a capital of the United States.  Of these, New York City and Philadelphia have the strongest claims of being the first capital.  One question to answer is what constitutes being the first capital.  Do we start the clock at the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the Article of Confederation, or the Constitution.  I think that the Constitution would be the key event because before that, America was really a group of independent colonies rather than a nation.

Also, I believe that New York City did not have the physical infrastructure (buildings, etc.) in place to be an actual capital for the newly formed government.  I think it acted more as a temporary meeting place.  Philadelphia did have a lot of infrastructure for the federal government because it was trying to woe the government into making Philly the permanent capital.

In my opinion, Philly should be considered the first capital of the U.S. because it had actual capital buildings that were used by the government after the signing of the Constitution.  The fact that Philly was also used as the first capital of the colonies is not relevent in my opinion.

However, I am not a historian or an expert in early American history, so I don't want to update the article myself.  Also, from my research, there seems to be a lot of contention about which city is the first capital.  Would a historian or professor of history please comment on this issue and update the page.

 My letter to NeinN 

I am not NeilN's psychiatrist, and, as I haven’t examined NeilN, I won’t diagnose him. But because NeilN has turned himself into a public laboratory of psychopathology, I want to talk about how I'd give direction to a universal human development of culture, ethics, and morality. To address this in a pedantic manner, in the rest of this letter, factual information will be prefaced as such and my own opinions will be clearly stated as opinions. For instance, it is a fact that people used to think I was exaggerating whenever I said that like other volage-brained sensualists, he has a finely honed ability to welsh on all types of agreements. After seeing NeilN precipitate riots these same people now realize that I wasn't exaggerating at all. In fact, they even realize that when a friend wants to drive inebriated, you try to stop him. Well, NeilN is drunk with power, which is why we must drive off and disperse the obdurate bohemians who manufacture outrage at his castigators by attributing to them all sorts of uppity fairy tales.

If the only way to stop the Huns at the gate is for me to fall prey to NeilN's rhetoric and obfuscation, then so be it. It would sincerely be worth it because he had promised us liberty, equality, and fraternity. Instead, NeilN gave us sensationalism, propagandism, and officialism. I suppose we should have seen that coming, especially since NeilN claims to be supportive of my plan to confront and reject all manifestations of feudalism. Don't trust him, though; he's a wolf in sheep's clothing. Before you know it, he'll treat traditional values as if they were rapacious crimes. Not only that, but some benighted bloodsuckers are actually considering helping NeilN cause one-sided inclinations to be entered into historical fact. How quickly such people forget that they were lied to, made fun of, and ridiculed by NeilN on numerous occasions.

It's scary how effectively NeilN has been making a mockery of the term """"disproportionableness"""". I deeply regret the loss of life and injuries sustained by this tragedy. I am currently working to understand the surrounding circumstances so as to improve our ability to plant markers that define the limits of what is untoward and what is not. We have a dilemma of leviathan proportions on our hands: Should we strip the unjust power from those who seek power over others and over nature, or is it sufficient to put him in his place? In answer to that question I submit—and millions of people in this country and abroad unmistakably agree with me—that Bourbonism has served as the justification for the butchering, torture, and enslavement of more people than any other """"ism"""". That's why it's NeilN's favorite; it makes it easy for him to mute the voice of anyone who dares to speak out against him. You might think this is all pretty funny now, but I doubt I'll hear you laughing if, faster than you can say """"floccinaucinihilipilification"""", NeilN is successfully able to use paid informants and provocateurs to make higher education accessible only to those in the higher echelons of society. I've heard numerous complaints about his behavior. Many people I've talked to have complained that NeilN comports himself like a filthy pig, heedless of all needs but his own. Among these needs the paramount one seems to be the need to burn books. This backs up my point that he likes saying that better governance can be achieved by granting profitable concessions, permits, waivers, zoning variances, monopolies, and other such political machinations to his band. Okay, that's a parody—but not a very gross one. In point of fact, NeilN is extremely mawkish. In fact, my handy-dandy Mawkish-O-Meter confirms that prudence is no vice. Cowardice—especially NeilN's deplorable form of it—is. Now that you've read the bulk of this letter, it should not come as a complete surprise that some of the things NeilN says and some of the things he stands for are so feckless, it hurts to think about them. However, this fact bears repeating again and again, until the words crack through the hardened exteriors of those who would make a big deal out of nothing. I am referring, of course, to the likes of NeilN.

 Goodbye everybody 

And what on earth is wrong about this article, specially if settet back where it originally belongs?
I do not accuse people to be socket puppet, I do not insult them with harsh and very illustrativ words, I do not call their articles for garbage or for saying nothing usefull, or for being idiots, nor ignorant, nor do I pretend that they do not contribute with anything on the talk page and never did, nor do I revert other users contributions, as YBM and rjb specially and mainly, as well as some other new users on the page like Maru that night and previous days did, and som other users belonging to the same side of the story.
If I had to be banished for that so had ybm and rjb and maru too and for a much longer period of time and their text to be removed, in fact all of them that night, as they didn't say much else but cynical and fruitless comments on other people works and destructiv critiscism who wasn't justify.
I tried more than 4 times to make them come v´back to ttheir mind and to sopt healding oil to the fire, but it didn't helped. They just had too much fun harrassing users all around the talk page, unpunished.
An objectiv analyse of the page will not only take much time but will most certainly show how true what I state here is.
There is a text that I do not found, an article with the copy/paste of the writting exchange between me and mister Jean Pierre Voyer, where he clearly stated his doing in this affair and his cooperation with YBM in the making of falsification of evidencies, and his arrogancy and proudness in doing so, added some discrepencies in his words and a major amount of respectlessness, and you have the picture of the person behind this all story.
I also received private mails from a mister Rupley, who is (which is) the name of one of YBMs' web site with plenty of litteracy of the kind of Voyer, and with links to Luven, also an ybms' website of the kind. It does not concern the Bogdanovs affair, but concentrate on the theories who corroborate the making of such a fake story and its justifications in doing so.
It's a hobby of some sort, like some like Shakespeare or a special branch of philosophy or politic or a sub for us mostly unknown special branch of a political - philosofical - opinionated - with social ramification kind of organisation, touching a very small group of individuals inclosed in their believes. 
There is plenty of the like all over the world, their reason for adding to those ideas are those people life and choices, which I do respect, but in that case, those idiosyncrasies (thats my own choice of denomination and not theirs)are being punched ininto the reality of a lot of people and involved real ideas.
I think of course about the balancing act of inplanting those high flying ideas to the reality of the thousands of internet users by imposing their vues inthis Bogdanov affair. By vues I do not mean the apparent version of the fact given by YBM about the validity of the actual thesis. No. It isn't what it is about. It is more complex than that. It is about playing with people reactions in a situation of confrontations and playing with lies. Creating stories, ideas, like gossips who have no bund in the rality but who will nonetheless create a reaction in the people who are witnessing it at the time, and build on further from those reactions, and add more and more stuff to keep the tension and the artificial affair going on.
It might not be as complicated as it sounds to bring those ideas to live, as it very quickly get a dynamic of its own who keep repeating itself, if some element are implemented along the way.

 Marduk = Abraham. 

The early prophet line is reflected in all the history of the world.

Marduk is a regional variant of Abraham. So is Zoroaster.

Adam as we know him, was the first prophet of Dyeus, and the first human consciousness we see in history. Dyeus, became Zeus, Jupiter (with piter from fertilitycult distortions) and Yah, etc. """"God"""" ofcourse for many.
Idris was the second prophet of Tengri, which became """"Thor"""" many places sometimes god, sometimes more of a prophet, and again """"Indra"""", """"Prometheus"""", """"Osiris"""".

 Reply Dear you are right in your argument.

The User   Walkie-talkie is coming out with some crasy arguments that there is nothing even to discuss about the """"Terrorist category"""". I don’t know whether he is thinking Wikipedia should be monopolized by the fascist Sri Lankan killers who are some or other way marginalizing the Tamils in Sri Lanka since the independence. He is talking about commonsense. I don’t think so even he has an iota of that.

If Anton Balasingham could be named as the chief strategist and the chief negotiator or the apologist of one of the most barbaric terrorist groups, what about the following atrocities against Sri Lankan Tamils since the independence by the Sri Lankan State.

If you go through the above incidents you will come to know they are many times worse than the highest number of suicide attacks which were targeted against innocent civilians by the LTTE.

I couldn’t understand what is the importance of that banning in 20 countries when hardly most of the countries civilians had not been killed by the LTTE attacks and the LTTE's activities are expanded into those countries only to the extent of fund raising from the expatriate Tamils.

He was the political adviser not the adviser to LTTE leader to carry out suicide attacks or to scheme military activities.

Composing the LTTE leader's annual speech or representing LTTE doesn’t qualify him for the """"Terrorist Tag"""" at all.

Why the talks failed every time was mainly the hardliners in the South and not by any of the Tamil groups or LTTE.

It is so stupid expecting he definitely knows all the crimes being carried out by the LTTE when he was utilised by the LTTE only at theoretical level and for negotiations.

I don’t know why that particular wikipedian feels sorry for him. For what?

""""Zervas was forced to resign in 1947, when details of his contacts with the German occupation authorities surfaced"""" This quote came from Wikepedia's biography of Napoleon Zervas. Other sites are more explicit and call him a Nazi collaborateur. Nowadays there are still a lot of greek people that believe that the Cham people were expelled because they collaborated with the Nazi's. However it was Zervas thet collaborated with the Nazi's that expelled them. Shouldn't this be more explicit in this article. There is a UN resolution which asks the Greek government to repatriate the cham and to give back there properties.The rest of this article is lame. I miss the following:

Copyright © 2006 Illyrians.org.
During the Conference of Ambassadors in London in 1913, the southern part of the region was cut off from the motherland and annexed to the Greek state despite the fact that people of the southern Epirus were Albanians of Orthodox and the Muslim faith. While the orthodox Albanians were targets of hellenization, the muslim Albanians were either exterminated or expelled from their ancestral lands by the Greek government.

Chams who lived in Southern Epirus (Chameria or Thesprotia as it is called by the Greeks) were the victims of the first ethnic cleansing in Europe at the end of the Second World War. The Cham tragedy is one of the most painful tragedies of the European continent. Statistical yearbook of the Greek government in 1936 showed that 26.000 Chams lived in Chameria region in Greece at that time.

As a result of the 1944-1945 ethnic cleansing and genocide, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region, and sought refuge in the Republic of Albania, where they still live. Today, there are 150.000 members of this population in Albania, a figure that has grown because of the high birth rate of the population. On the other hand, current number of Cham Albanians living in Greece is estimated at around 100.000. Yet these people are deprived of every sort of minority rights like other minorities living in Greece. To cite but one example, they can speak Albanian only in their homes.

The population of Chameria has always been ethnically Albanian: - A lot of voyagers and foreign historians wrote that Chameria had been populated by Albanians. Even the Greek historian Herodotus underscored this fact in his book Historias and called Albanians of the Chameria barbarians, a term used by the ancient Greeks to distinguish non-greek people. - The census held by the Turkish Administration in 1910 established that there were 83.000 orthodox and muslim Albanians in the region. The demographic map of the British military mission sent to the British government in London indicates that on the eve of the second World War, 75% of Chameria's population was Albanian. - The pro-Greek historian Spiro Muselimi, in his book """"Historical Sight Through Thesprotia"""", edited in Joannina on 1974, wrote that """"The bishop of Thesprotia in the year 1870 translated some parts of Bible into Albanian, as the people of orthodox faith of the region did not understand any word in Greek"""" .

The Greek authorities, sticking to the concept of absolute denial of the existence of ethnic groups on Greek territory, have followed a well-established chauvinistic policy and, as history recorded, they committed genocide against the Albanians of muslim faith. The racial assault on Chameria's muslim Albanians began to be first applied at the end of the Second World War, in 1944-1945, when criminal bands of the notorious General Napoleon Zervas perpetrated ethnic cleansing against them.

On June 27, 1944, Greek criminal bands resorted to the worst atrocities witnessed in this region. The terror committed against this population was beyond description. It included killings, rapes, inhuman treatment, massacre of women, babies and pregnant women. More than 1400 men, women and children were killed within 24 hours in the town of Paramithy, on Tuesday, June 27, 1944, which happened to be the date of St.Bartholomeus day for the whole Chameria.

During the June 1944-March 1945 period, 1286 persons were killed in Filat, 192 people were killed in Gumenica, 626 persons were killed in Margellic and Parga. There were hundreds of other missing persons. In the same period, as a result of Greek massacres, acts of robbery and rapes against the Albanian population of Chameria; 2900 young and old men, 214 women, 96 children were massacred, 745 women were raped, 76 women abducted, 32 children, younger than 3 years were massacred, 68 villages were razed to the ground, 5800 houses and places of worship were burned dow",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

I think both versions are about as neutral as each other, but there are two reasons why I went with Mies' wording.
 The actual options for the lede sentence upon which we are !voting have not changed, and
 I don't want Mies to complain after the fact that the wording was skewed. Very little happens in this particular little corner of Wikipedia without either Mies' approval or anguished and dogged resistance. I would like him to feel that the process is as open and transparent as possible. Sentence options 1 and 2 are those which emerged from a far longer list as being the binary choices, and option 3 is Mies' own wording, which I think is an excellent compromise.
I guess, after this RfC is closed, we can argue about the effect of changing the brief, neutral wording mid-stream, and maybe those on the losing side can call for another one, but there is another option available to all who have already !voted - simply reëvaluate your original !vote and modify it if you think modification is needed.

My feeling is there is no reason to go overboard questioning the basis of these claims, since it is simply possible to write the entry making clear that they are claims. It is not the place of this talk page to conduct some kind of forensic investigation into the validity or otherwise of Mr Langan's IQ (I'm not saying that is what you are doing, just making a point). I agree with you that at this high end of the scale the measurement of IQ probably becomes quite inexact, but after all that is not Mr Langan's fault. I note also that not only is there no evidence Mr Novelly is lying, neither is there any evidence that Mr Langan has lied. That doesn't make his claims true, but the claims themselves are plausible as claims, and as claims they are reported in legitimate secondary sources. I think it is clear that Mr Langan is, as you put it succinctly, frickin' smart. That is the real point of the IQ claims, and it is the basis of the interest in Mr Langan, since people are interested in the limits of how frickin' smart people can be.

Here are violations you have done here. WP:3RR, WP:AGF, WP:CIVIL, WP:POINT, WP:THREAT, No Personal Attack. You must read the article again, especially the intro. """"Defrauding people of money is presumably the most common type of fraud, but there have also been many fraudulent """"discoveries"""" in art, archaeology, and science.""""  The latter two fields are distinctly separate even thought archeoology is a kind of social science, scholarly, it belongs to anthropology and history. Fujimura is an archaeologist, so that his case has been a good example of the archaeological fraud. Therefore, you should've provided a good rationale for your removal of the perfect example from the article. Rather, you insist on replacing it with Korean example in order to retaliate against my revert. You also placed the new addition at the top of the section, and the placement is very odd because if you really want to compromise with me, you should've made a group to Fujimura, the other archaeological case and the science case. You think Hwang Woo-seok case is more notable and I think Fujimura is more notable, so we disagree on the point. Besides, google search result is sometimes deceptive, and it is also funny that Japanese editors strongly disagreed to reflect the method at Dokdo and Sea of Japan. hmm.. double standard?

In addition, you blatantly lie that I erased your addition and don't want it to be included. Your threats and personal attacks truly degrade your reputation and credibility.

I would hope that you read both the source and my points fully before making your edit and writing your response.

As I initially said the source is biased - it is true. They state themselves that their very organisation was set up initially purely to oppose Nuclear Power.

Let's leave that to one side however, we could always come back to it later.

The crux of my point, leaving aside the bias issue, is three-fold. 

Firstly, irrespective of your argument that this is presented as a claim, the fact remains that the way the claim is presented is illogical - there is no fair comparator for the claim that """"Nuclear Power is neither efficient nor effective in cutting CO2 emissions"""". A fair comparator should be found or some idea of efficiency viz. inefficiency should be presented, if even from the biased source itself, before re-inserting this part. Without it, it is on the same level as saying something as intellectually vacant as """"some people claim that Ferraris are not fast machines"""". Not exactly the sort of style an Encyclopaedia should be aiming for, especially on a scientific article, would you not agree?

Secondly, with respect to your argument, the very empirical information the underlying source uses is being mistreated in what amounts to, if I may say, a misuse of data on a level which is so obvious it it would actually be quite comical if it were where it belonged along with many thousands of other equally lazy special interest group papers. It is  a self-contradicting source. Here's why:

It makes its supposition that Nuclear Power is inefficient at cutting CO2 emissions by producing a table of data. The data shows """"Yearly Costs to Avoid 1000kg of CO2 Emissions"""". These are divided between Energy Conservation Measures and Energy Production Methods. Nuclear Power is shown to be more efficient than solar power and as efficient as wind power at cutting emissions. However, the only conclusion the article draws is that Nuclear Power is inefficient at cutting CO2 emissions. By your logic, I could equally claim in this article using the same source that """"some environmental groups claim Wind and Solar Power are inefficient at cutting CO2 emissions"""". You can see how this would get a little crazy, no?

Thirdly, there is only one quoted source yet the text reads """"but environmental organizations indicate the problems with nuclear waste and claim that this energy is neither efficient nor effective in cutting CO2 emissions, excluding it from clean energy"""". Why is it pluralised? Surely the text should read something along the lines of """"the WISE group, a Dutch anti-nuclear lobby group indicate the problems..."""".

In conclusion, I can see the point you are trying to raise here is based on one guideline - as a claim, it is not presented as fact. That would be fine for articles dealing with philosophical issues, or political issues or any other number of normative debates. But we are not discussing ethics here. We are discussing the efficiency of Nuclear Power in cutting CO2 Emissions. We have to hold Scientific articles to a higher level of proof when it comes to """"making claims"""" or worse, """"stating beliefs"""". Science, prima facie, is about the pursuit of absolute truth, not the espousal of circumscribed belief. That way leads to the abuse of Science.

I'm happy to believe that the name """"Blackbeard"""" is used to describe a character in an upcoming movie. The issue for this article is why that is sufficiently significant to the modern cultural understanding of Blackbeard, for it to warrant inclusion in the article on the historical figure. Simply stating that Blackbeard is mentioned in a modern-day film/book/comic/play doesn't tell us anything about how the historical figure is interpreted, and risks being indiscriminate information which does little to advance our understanding of the topic. I suspect before we include the fact that Blackbeard wll be mentioned in yet another modern movie, we would need to know how this mention is of enduring cultural significance. I also doubt that the real-life Blackbeard can be presented in a historically accurate context in the otherwise fictional universe of POTC> More likely, and with all respect to Ian McShane, it is likely Blackbeard will simply be a large black-bearded pirate who has matches in his beard and says """"Yarr."""" An entertaining figure no doubt, but not one that advances this article, which is about the real-life Caribbean pirate.

I don't mean this to sound snarky, so my apologies if it comes across that way. It's just that articles like this can quickly amass extensive and fairly trivial lists of mentions, including every time the subject is even referred to in sitcoms and the like. Check out the page history from about a year ago, to see what I mean. I'd prefer not to return to simple lists of mentions, even when Blackbeard is a major character in the film/novel/comic/TV episode. Instead and for what its worth, I support Parrot's suggestion of mentioning it at the film's article, where it has apropriate context.

To present this information as if CPI(M) members are singular in their violence is not a correct viewpoint if violence is ongoing between many parties.

Saying """"One source claimed that an organization called Harmath is a militant arm..."""" might be better, but we must take care not to use that as a gateway to simply reprint the article here.

Thanks, that may at least defuse things a little.  

My personal thought is that if this is to get any mention on Ferdinand or Ferry Porsche's page the text should relate to them directly, rather than being the same cut and paste sentence.  

Mentioning that Ferdinand Porsche gets most of the popular credit for a lot of things that were actually as much or more a product of his employees, and pointing out that this is common practice in the design industry  the boss gets the credit  would be a bit more NPOV.  Mentioning Komenda as one of those who gets overlooked in favor of the boss would be OK for me too.

 22:46, 28 Oct 2003 (UTC)

Before I get any further on this subject, I would like clarificaton about the relative roles of Ferdinand and Ferry in this issue.  I would like to see the fact of Ferdinand's univolvement nailed down before I approach the matter of Ferry, or before I try to address the simple revert battle now going on here.

The bulk of the story clearly belongs on the Komenda page.  A one-sentence reference on the Ferry page saying that Ferry's claim is disputed is appropriate, and it should then refer those who want more on the story to the Komenda page.  01:57, 2003 Oct 29 (UTC)

This is the situation that I think is the truth, from my reading.  When Ferdinand Porsche set up an independent engineering consultancy in Germany (in the 30s?) although he was the company founder and head engineer he employed a number of other engineers - the jobs were too big for just one man.  Among the men he employed was Erwin Komenda, who had previously worked for Daimler-Benz and before that Steyr.  Komenda was an expert in auto body construction and the engineering of pressed sheet metal bodywork, that I can determine.  

Ferdinand Porsche's field of expertise seems to have been the mechanical aspects of vehicles, engines and the like, and the overall team direction.  Komenda worked on the bodywork of the KDF-wagen (later to become the Beetle) among others.  Komenda definitely worked on translating ideas for the basic shape into sheet metal and the detail design of the bodywork.  Many of the plans and patent applications from this period are signed by Komenda and applied for with his name on them.  Whether his were the first pencil sketches that were turned into auto bodies I am less sure.  It's certainly possible that they were, though I am sure others in the team including Ferdinand Porsche had a lot of input.

JUST A THOUGHT:

Shouldn't this page consider division into chapters:

(i.e.)
Early Life
WWI
WWII

Porche is a fascinating man with a career so linked with the World Wars  but that almost seems lost and in this bio. His involvement in WWII with the Nazis in both the Racing circuit and in the War effort really shaped his life and that that of the world. He represents a true place in history - so perhaps a chapter insersion could better work here.  Just a suggestion.
DH - 10/16/05
Postwar, Porsche's son Ferry and the other engineers who had worked for Ferdinand during the war came together (initially in Austria) to design cars.  Ferdinand was imprisoned until 1949 for war crimes relating to the use of slave labor in projects he worked on.

Between them, a car was designed that became the Porsche 356.  Komenda played a big part in this.  It would be incorrect to say that he was the designer, per se, because he only worked on the bodywork.  However, its construction was his, and probably much of its styling.  He also worked in a similar capacity for later Porsche cars.

What I think needs to be done is to write more about Ferdinand's consultancy and Ferry's postwar sports car company so Komenda can be placed in his proper context.  WHen part of a larger article it will seem less 'heavy'.

 Borges' Apocryphal Quote 

Is """"apocryphal"""" the correct word.  In Royce's The World and the Individual, available on Archive.org, he begins a discussion (in the Supplemental Essay) as follows: """"let us suppose, if you please, that a portion of the surface of England is very perfectly levelled and smoothed, and is then devoted to the production of our precise map of England. That in general, then, should be found upon the surface of England, map constructions which more or less roughly represent the whole of England, — all this has nothing puzzling about it. Any ordinary map of England spread out upon English ground would illustrate, in a way, such
possession, by a part of the surface of England, of a resemblance to the whole. But now suppose that this our resemblance is to be made absolutely exact, in the sense previously defined.""""  Royce goes on for awhile.

Borges may have massaged, and shortened considerably, the quote, but the idea is still Royce's (it is also discussed in Russell's Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy).

e4d907f77d1156ab,"I wonder why you think it's absurd to a) try and raise funds for those harmed by a natural disaster and b) to prove once and for all that these repetitive - almost chanting - claims I am Ennis are false. If the 'Number is Ennis' dichotomy was removed the Talk Pages would be near empty! I wonder why you condemn my attempts to bring honesty to these pages.

But, that's rhetorical - as I said, there must be certain camaraderie among Wiki people and I doubt if you’d want to jeopardise that even if your quest was integrity.

Now you have asked me a sensible question, so I'll answer.

For some time I watched these pages and saw that posts from people in the UK/claiming they were in the UK were summarily dismissed. Worse, posters were automatically accused of being Ennis.

One reason given was that the posts were anonymous.

So I thought, as I know more about Ennis than others from the UK posting here (IMO) I'd try to add to these pages. However, even with an identity, I got exactly the same treatment. In fact Cardinal Chunder also got the same treatment even though he has an anti-Sollog website and is well known in Google groups for arguing with sollog(ites).

So it became clear that it would be impossible to add anything constructive unless either the accusations 'You're a sock puppet! You’re Ennis!' were either suppressed or disproved.

I therefore asked what the criteria would be to 'prove' I was not Ennis - and presumably this criteria would apply to others. 

I tried to prove I was not in America (I thought these days all IPs were traceable but perhaps the 'proxy argument' holds sway - though quite how 'proxies work' is beyond me) I quoted extracts from a newspaper that was not on the net.

This was dismissed.

Someone else even went to a pub in Lyndhurst and posted what was next to where he was sitting.

That too was dismissed.

So it became obvious that no proof I (or anyone else) was not Ennis would ever be accepted.

Therefore the only other option if I felt I had something to contribute would be to suppress the hyena-like accusations (never backed up BTW)

In vain did I quote Wiki Official Policy. Plainly it is not obeyed by Editors/Administrators vis a vis the treatment of contributors.

So what is left? I cannot invoke Wiki policy. I cannot 'prove' I am here, in England sitting quietly in front of a PC.

Two choices.

Stop posting completely

Try and 'challenge' the main accuser so once and for all this behaviour would stop. The only challenge worth it would be one where I did not personally gain (Of course I would win because I am not Ennis) and where proof involving a third party held in esteem (e.g. Ashley) acted as 'witness'.

Hence the challenge.

I fear that will be deleted; I'll be castigated a usual and that's that. It really is just hopeless.

I have started deleting all my posts and if the challenge is reverted I’ll know there simply is no hope and I'll delete all my posts if I can find them.

You see, unless people accept I am not Ennis everything I or anyone else writes who is similarly accused will simply be dismissed. I'd prefer it if people read the post without looking at the poster - but they don't.

I have other interests - I posted on the Yoga page but it's quiet and I am interested in politics etc etc.

So we'll see what happens. Like I said, my view is that it's just hopeless trying to treat others as adults as all some want to do is - and they admit this - bait, bait and bait and if you do rise to it you're banned and if you don't it shows your inability. Truly a page that brings out the juvenile in what I assume are adults.

So there you are. I have answered your question fully and honestly and we'll just see what happens. It will answer the question - at least for these Sollog pages - as to whether Wiki should be taken seriously or not.

Finally if, as expected, the post is reverted it will provide a fitting end to the article I am writing (I am a freelance writer and no, I’m not going to prove it) before I send it off to newspapers.

Most importantly, the anonymously sourced article is the only news source claiming Artie has stabbed himself.  All other articles covering the suicide attempt refer to the New York Post as their only reference.

I can't see women buying rape oil. Even if they know better, it sounds like an antisocial alternative to KY jelly. 

If I recall correctly, regular rape oil is a drying oil, mostly used industrially, perhaps in some specialty paints. It's toxic, but I don't know *how* toxic. (A lot of the foods we eat are toxic. Salt is a necessity, but a cup of salt would be lethal to half of all adults who ingest it.)

 M-hmmmmmm....... 

So, you think that I was ranting, when during the entire article I explicitly noted that I am not, and that this is a serious issue that need not be """"stricken down"""" as hate speech or ranting. Let me rebut all the things you posted on my talk page:

- Ok, """".com"""" stands for commerce, but if you read my post without any bias in mind, that wasn't even my argument. I was just basically pointing out the fact that """".co.uk"""" is explicitly UK, and that """".com"""" can be anything, though it is necessarily NOT explicitely UK, as many of Wiki's articles seem to be.

- Yes, I said I didn't know where to start, meaning I didn't know where to begin addressing the issue, not that I don't know where to start addressing this issue.

- """"Secondly, there is Wiki policy that articles dealing with American topics have American English spellings, and articles about British stuff have British English spellings. If White House has British spellings in it, by all means change them to the US ones.""""
    
 I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to tell me here, but my guess is that you assume that I don't know about the current Wikipolicy, and that you obviously don't understand what I clearly stated. I am arguing that Wikipedia should either have ALL British spelling, or ALL standard English spelling (a.k.a - """"American english), but preferabally standard English because this isn't a British website, and because as an encyclopedia, all the information should be unified under one context and/or dialect.

- My point wasn't """"British are the only people that use British spelling."""" (although in a literal sense, this is a strong point outside of context), it was that """"The majority of the English speaking population use Standard English."""". If I seemed to use the former point, then either the way you interpreted my words was wrong, or I misworded my intentional argument. If I did, then my apologies.

- """"But every other English-speaking country used the standard spelling, which is generally based on how the word actually sounds"""" 
Again, you missed a subtle point that changed the entire meaning of my words. See the word generally? What I mean by this, if you can't already comprehend, is that many words in the British spelling include silent letters. Here's an example of one: pAEdophile. If one trys to pronounce this word by the letters, it would sound something like """"PAH-EHD-OH-FILE"""", adding an extra syllable, when it's really pronounced """"PE-DOH-FILE"""", which pretty much follows how the Standard English form is spelled. 

- I'm not very new to Wiki, and if that's a subtle way for you to try to undermind my intelligence, then I resent that statement. And again, do not take my words as rants. Anybody who understands the inherent nature of an encyclopedia understands that this is an important issue. Anyways, the way I worded my post was nowhere near the definition of a rant, please use a dictionary and find out what a rant is for yourself.

Please, if you can't understand the importance of this issue solely based on personal agenda (I understand you are British), then stay out of this. You have no credibility if this is the case since you cannot make a rational decision. If you haven't noticed, everything I posted had rationale behind it.

c87c412b3cd854d4,"""I agree with Kevin entirely. The first paragraph of the section is highly debatable. Certainly, """"Jews!""""-slogan is a recent invention. Condescending use of the epitaph has been around a lot longer, unfortunately. In that light, the paragraph needs serious revision.
Also, it would greatly benefit from mentioning last year's attempts by the club to reduce if not eradicate the slogans altogether . The club argued it was inappropriate and hurtful to many of the club's Jewish supporters, the statement must be out there on ajax.nl.
Regardless of any of the above, hardcore Ajax supporters are not exclusively Jewish, neither currently nor historically, which is definitely worth mentioning in light of the symbols and slogans.

 Harry Potter is a Girl 

Dear Jimbo, I posted something here and it was archived because it was viewed that after a 3 day ban I was too expert in the use of WP:XXXX rules to be a newbie. It was said """"Will be archived: If you ever want to return, Jimbo can discuss this message (and your ADMINISTRATORS comment below) from his talk-page archives."""" I don't even know what that means. Here is my reply to the person that said that. And then the thing that was archived. The longer article was deleted off the page I put it on. I will glance back at my talk page to see if you have anything to say on this matter. If not I understand that it is not your issue. I would though prefer if you looked at it since that was my point, that people in power beneath you seem to want to bite the newbie to the point that the newbie is leaving and not coming back. They even suggested that my issue was with the WP:3RR rule which was not the issue. As a newbie I didn't know about that, and learned my lesson. It was with the time on the talk page being attacked by a WP:GANG / WP:TAGTEAM which are supported by administrators. So the person who archived my comments of your talk page didn't even get the point. Once I was told of the WP:3RR rule I never even touched the article again. Anyway hopefully you will actually read this before someone else finds a WP:XXXX rule as an excuse to delete it. 86.93.139.223  

So you understand, I had 3 days of a block to read the many WP:XXXX that were thrown at me, to then understand them. So while it might be hard for you to believe that someone can read in 3 days a bunch of WP:XXXX rules, it is not impossible. Actually I didn't have to read many, just the ones that were used against me to have me blocked. As I found, they were being totally misquoted against me. So yeah, you might find it hard to believe, you might also want to go to the Alkaline Diet article and look at how many people said exactly the same thing as I did in the past on the article. Is that hard to believe? Don't bother answering, just know that you might want to look at the history and deal with it. I don't understand why this was taken off Jimbo Wales' page by someone other than him with a note hard to believe. Isn't that his choice? Yes I would like him to discuss it with me. As I put it on his page with the express comment that the people (like you) who are in between him and me are the problem. So you making a personal judgement that someone can't read a few Wiki WP:XXXX rules in 3 days gives you the right to ignore my very detailed comments. Sorry but this is exactly the reason I contacted Jimbo and not you. Maximus. 86.93.139.223 (talk)  86.93.139.223  

Dear Jimbo, This is a part of a longer post on the Alkaline Diet page called Harry Potter is a Girl. As I am a newbie I don't know how to do links so copied it here. Sorry for taking your space up on your talk page. Also sorry for WP:TLDR. Please delete this if it is of no interest to you. I can't know what is and what is not of interest to you, and following WP:BOLD I am making my statement and you can decide what to do next. I have put it here as I wanted you to know of my experience here at Wikipedia and how after a few days due to repeated WP:BITE I am leaving Wikipedia editing never to return. Because the people between you and me are the problem I thought to go straight to the top. Sometimes the people at the top don't get told what is going on below them. Anyway thanks for Wikipedia. Good luck and perhaps reduce the number of rules / guidelines as I think they are being manipulated and misused.

 Wikia links in the SF articles 

There's little point, other than advertising, to randomly link to a wikia when an article is already on wikipedia. Unless you've got a solid reason for adding a link, you shouldn't add it.  
That's fine and dandy, but you'll find that adding a link to an article for advertising purposes is against wikipedia's policies. It doesn't help that the articles on the SF wikia are apparently copy and paste from existing articles here, which negates them further. Sorry, but they have to go.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Qumar:deletion
This… I don’t know where to start!
In no particular order:-
.a)I found this had been deleted when it turned up on my watchlist,, though I never saw the discussion there; presumably because it was on another page, and this deletion looks like an afterthought.
.b) “decision was to merge with The West Wing # Foreign …""""
Well, actually it wasn’t.
3 voted for merging Equatorial Kundu and Qumar in a new page Fictional Countries in the West Wing;
2 voted for merge and re-direct to WW#F (3 if you count yourself)
2 others had no preference.
In the event you didn’t even do that; a search for Qumar leads to the top of the WW page, making it necessary to scroll through to find it.
.c) I find it hard to believe this would be agreeable to anyone who is interested in, or has contributed to, the WW pages; does that describe anyone who spoke on this decision? 
.d)The reason for the proposal isn’t that clear; “not notable”? So where does that leave all the other pages about fictional characters, places, histories?
.e)“can be re-created if sources are found to establish out-of-universe notability”; what does that mean? If it’s referred to in a book, like a commentary on the West Wing (though you don’t know, and haven’t checked, if there is one)? (for the record, there are at least 5 in the British Library Catalogue, and at least one in our town library; shall I check? Would it make any difference?
.f)“theres nothing on the page that isn’t said elsewhere""""; Well, there was quite a big page before (from memory), now there’s just a paragraph, so something has gone. And if information is in several places, what does it matter? It makes sense to repeat things/items/details from various places onto a single page to make the information more accessible; even real encyclopaedias can do that, the more so a virtual one.
.g) ) The page wasn’t (again, from memory) badly written, or un-encyclopaedic, especially compared to some of the pages I’ve seen; is WP so big that we can afford to be tearing decent pages out? (it’s still not as big or as comprehensive as a decent-sized city library).

The discrepancy in the size of the dataset can perhaps be explained by the wording in the CfMR article which implies that the 556 case dataset was an earlier study “cited” in McDowell’s 1985 paper, not the main subject of it. The difference in percentages between CfMR and mediaRADAR might be explained by CfMR citing McDowell correctly, while the 60% figure was obtained by someone just adding the 80 “false” cases to the 256 “inconclusive” ones and calling them all false.

One reason that the study is often attributed to McDowell and Hibler is their 1987 book """"Practical aspects of rape investigations"""" http://books.google.ca/books?id=iV398oA5DdsC&pg;=PA181&lpg;=PA181&dq;=charles+mcDowell+practical+rape+investigation&source;=bl&ots;=P2Yt9i_z6y&sig;=R-ezsxhzIw3KPJYGnybSBJp2BX8&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=0_59T8SGI6Xd0QGRoPTHDg&ved;=0CCsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q;=charles%20mcDowell%20practical%20rape%20investigation&f;=false , and so likely published there.  Perhaps we should disprove the existance of this book, before claiming that an unused potentially wrong version of McDowell exists invalidates that mcdowell exists.

As you know, having replied there before, this matter is already being discussed here, two headings up.  Perhaps the two heading should be merged to prevent confusion.  I'd hate for someone to stumble on this """"Recent Karwynn deletions heading and, by no intention of your own, think that I deleted disputed material without discussing it on the talk page.  Either way, here's what I have to say about the matter.  I know it's long, but bear with me - you might find the rambling actually makes some sense.

Weasel Words
Your examples of improving weasel statements should be appreciated for what they are, but unfortunately, they don't really apply here.  The full process you linked to involved escalating from """"some say"""" to """"BUsh's critics"""" to """"Michael Moore"""" followed by accounts of a specific statement, namely, Moore's letter to Bush.  Here, that process has not been fully employed.  Unlike the specifically referenced Moore letter to Bush, which was direct and obvious in who it represented, these sources themselves still contain weasel words; take this sentence: A White House long accused of squelching internal dissent and ignoring outside viewpoints.  Accused by whom?  As I said before, just because weasel words are sourced, even directly quoted, doesn't make them ok.  n your example, the weasel words were eliminated by referencing the source of criticism directly.  """"Michael Moore said whatever"""".  In this case, we still haven't discovered who is doing all the accusing.  To say that the Washington Post is making the accusation is inaccurate.  To say that the Washington Post says that Bush has been """"long accused"""" is an accurate weasel statement, not worthy of inclusion in an encyclopedia.  It fails verifiability as well, come to think of it: the article certainly doesn't bother to support the sentence.  Read it for yourself.  They just throw it out there.  Verifiability doesn't mean """"you can find it somewhere else"""", it means """"It's been or can be verified to be true"""".  Perhaps it can be, but this article doesn't do it.  Do you see the difference between this case and the example provided in the WP:AWW guideline?  In the guideline's example, the weasel words were overcome by citing.  In this case, they still remain, because they are inherent in the source itself.

Citing the opinions of these articles
Well, this problem should speak for itself.  Opinions, including those of journalists, should not be cited as support for a claim.  It would be one thing if these criticisms were being mentioned to verify their existence (see Laura Ingraham, an article in which numerous criticisms are used to self-verify, but not used to support a claim within the article that Laura Ingraham is good or bad or this or that), as they are for many public figures, but they are being used as support for this """"particularly notable because"""" statement.  As I said before, which was ignored this... well, I'll just repost what I said before.
It's not a neutral article, nor is it a notably important surce. It's just another source. I could find an article that says something along the lines of """"Stephen Colbert proved that he is a manipulative, arrogant polemicist who cares nothing for social graces and only wishes to make a name for himself by being extreme and controversial"""", and if I stuck that sentence in the article's main body and referenced it, it would be (rightly) reverted before long. The same if I found an article saying that the accusations against Bush being intolerant of dissention were just a knee-jerk criticism and a political tool, lacking any merit. We shouldn't be able to throw political commentary into articles without restraint based on the premise that it's """"sourced"""". This entire statement contains non-neutral commentary about the performance; I don't care if it came from somewhere else, it's still not neutral to include it.
So here are my thoughts on this point, summed up.
Citing opinions is fine for verifying the existence of those opinions/criticisms, but not for supporting the Wikipedia article's opinionated claims (which, see above, shouldn't be in there in the first place).
This article is not notable to the subject matter.  It's very broad, compared to the narrowness of the article's subject (and, even narrower, it's notability and the cause of it).  The specific criticisms are not uncommon, and the article's themselves are not controversial.  They are not important enough to be set apart as evidence pertaining to the performance's notability and Bush's reputation.  Additionally, the source is more focuse",0,0,0,0,0,0,False
02df732c2dcab497,"Thanks to all for taking my rather offhand comment seriously.  To reiterate my original explanatoin to James: I'm interested in this more on a meta level (how do we approach controversial subjects) than out of deep feelings one way or the other towards Moore and his film; that is, I'm trying to see the forest of making a good article on the film rather than the trees of every factual detail within the film that contributors might have multiple viewpoints about.  For an encyclopedia based around the concept of a Neutral Point of View, any attempt to either counter or defend the content of a subject that is, in itself, an editorial statment seems wrong; such discussions wind up as parasites draining the life and meaning out of an otherwise useful article.  See, for example, something like Roe v. Wade  there's no need to use that article to debate all the pros and cons of the subject involved  there are other articles for that linked at the bottom  just state the facts about the case.  Even if you really consider Moore's movie to be completely indefinsible propaganda (and to risk the Wiki-equivalent of Godwin's Law here), note that the article on Triumph of the Will doesn't feel the need to explain all the reasons why Nazi Germany wasn't all it was cracked up to be.   Similarly, shouldn't we just describe the content of the movie (noting that it is controversial), and then if we want an article about the Bin Laden family departure or whatever we can put the facts about that subject there?   20:19, 5 Jul 2004 (UTC)",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

WRONG retard, The good ending is not the canon ending. Wheeler only said that no one knows what happened to Cybil. She could have simply sneaked back into town, backed up her belongings and fled town to start a new life. If you had paid attention while playing SH: Homecoming, you would have learned that Wheeler said that The Order is one to bear a grudge. They don't take kindly to people that don't share their beliefs. And they are known to have the ability to track people down. And in the translated book of memories, Silent Hill Hiroyuki Owaku stated that Cybil's fate is """"left to players' imaginations"""".

Also, SH4 revealed that SH2 protagonist James Sunderland disappeared when he went to Silent Hill. Does that mean he died too? NO, not at all.

 While I respect the fact that you've obviously given this some thought, a few counterpoints: 1) Every single state in the union, with the possible exception of Rhode Island (mostly because it's so damn tiny), is a """"transitional"""" state with the features you mentioned. Examples: California includes ghettos, really rich gated comunities, hick towns (such as Watsonville, or virtually any city more than 100 miles from the coast), and the Bay Area. New York? Same deal, if you've ever been to upstate New York you'll see. And of course, the reverse is true too - a lot of Texas is really nice, progressive even. I've heard some less-than-terrible things about Birmingham, Alabama. Even Okla-dumbass-homa has some okay parts of Tulsa.

What a complete crock.

He does not have to defend himself to you, and you are the only person who thinks he is abusive.  I don't expect you to apologize, but know this, if you continue on the path you are on now, you will get blocked.— dαlus Contribs 
You are continuing to misrepresent my original objection.  My objection was NOT that 'he didn't respond in 8 hours', or anything like that.  (You portrayed that as my objection, though!).  Instead, I objected that Dodo wasn't addressing MY ACTUAL OBJECTIONS.  Other than his 'driveby deletions', and a template or two, he DIDN'T respond to my complaints.  Not only  did he not address my objections within a day (as you implied my original complaint was), he didn't even EVENTUALLY address my objections!  Irresponsibly, and probably maliciously, you tried to make me look like 'the bad guy' for objecting to Dodo's repeated rapid deletions without waiting for consensus, etc.
Dodo was trying to act on the theory, 'if somebody does ANYTHING even arguably criticizable, I can slap him down repeatedly by deleting his edits, without waiting for any sort of consensus, etc.'  (Evidently, that is your position as well.)  I say, """"No!"""".  Dodo never, in detail, responded to my repeated and DETAILED complaints of his behavior.  Is the reason that 'he is busy'?  Well, if he's SO BUSY, 
why did he have enough time to repeatedly delete my posts?  Doesn't make sense, does it?  The answer is quite simple:  Dodo (and, I suspect, many other self-appointed 'Info-Nazi's' ALWAYS have time to slap down other users (that's EASY, and takes little time!), but they DON'T have enough time to actually defend their own actions when challenged!  Dodo (and many others) amount to semi-professional BUSYBODIES who strut their stuff by interfering with others' use of WP.  Stop it.

However Underwood's effect is plain as day, and as such should be mentioned. The reason I'm leery of the 'custodians' of the page is because in adding the Bob Black bombing I encountered the same kind of opposition.

Yes, you will be blocked and your thoughtful post here deleted by someone like Tarc.  The main thing to realize is that Wikipedia has always been, and will always be, a clusterfuck.  If you're interested in finding out detailed histories of the lives of anime characters, it's a start, but other than that, it's virtual pages are only good for wiping virtual shit out of your virtual asshole.  This place attracts the worst kind of assholes, and it's hard to trust in the good faith of something from which nothing but shit and hot air spews forth.  They decide what a proper source is, they decide what's been discussed in the media, just like they decide which place in SF has the best glory holes.  Any type of internet arrangement with a hierarchy attracts the worst type of vaginal discharge.

One last thing. Tiptoety, I was not a part of ED but you successfully drove me there – I opened an account a couple of days ago. I honestly tried to start on a clean slate and somehow contribute to Wikipedia with a healthy portion of common sense. Unfortunately, I fell victim to bureaucratic masturbation, which is fairly common here. You people have given me the ultimate proof that admins, bureaucrats, checkusers etc. don't know the first thing about properly investigating sockpuppets and block evaders. You fling arbitrary blocks by association, protect wikibullies, bite newcomers, """"guard"""" articles based on communal POVs (yes, yes, don't even try and deny it), refuse to exercise the tiniest bit of common sense in any situation... the list can go on for much longer, I just don't give a fuck anymore. Rest assured I'll have a new username sometime in the near future, I still want to be a good contributor because I really want to make Wikipedia better, as opposed to what the so-called """"seasoned editors"""" do here. It's like a badly run political party in here. You're the same bunch of trolls as ED... the difference is that at least they admit it while you pretentiously mask yourselves as a """"civil community""""... my ass.

The 7th word in your third sentence in the discussion, beginning """"As an Athiest ..."""" Shirulashem (talk)

We don't block to punish. In fact, we shouldn't seek to punish here at all. And of course blocking someone who is already inflamed will cause them to leave/detonate: that's one of the many reasons we don't issue cool-down blocks any more. ➨ ❝ЯEDVERS❞ a sweet and tender hooligan

It is very funny to learnthat a stupid fuck'in   is trying to clean up the Kamboja articles. This person himself is totally disoriented and utterly confused, mentally/intellectually; and it is also very clear from his comment somewhere else about Kamboj-related articles that he does not even know the very basics of the Kamboj history. It is really funny to know how this idiot (and his ilk) are confusing the Indian journal """"Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency"""" with  the Handbook of the Bombay Presidency? How come these idiots, who can not even correctly interpret or understand the historical references/citations, be entrusted with the task to edit serious articles on ancient people like the Kambojas? It is  also amusing to learn that such-like dorks are trying to define the historical out-lines of the Kamboj history on Wikipedia! It is highly desirable that these fuck'in self-styled Wikipedia administrators/commentators first need to learn  to correctly interpret and interpret the historical references. Only then may they be qualified to comment on the serious topic like Kamboj history or else earn the rights to edit informative articles on this wlllknown ancient historical People. Also these jerks first need to understand that the citations and quotations used in the Kamboj related articles are from the most scholarly writers on this subject. It is shameful that these FEW F*- SELF-STYLED IDIOT ADMINSTIRATORS (LIKE DABU(DAB),ITSMJUDITH and the like) are trying to sit on judgement on the Kamboj history on Wikipedia and are bent on distorting or deleting the genuine information about them which is not found in the books writtemn in English, Fench or German by their European writers! Well, if you can interpret even the references quoted in an article, howcome can you sit in judgement and offer your scholarly comments on the Kamboj history? It is first necessary that these adminitrators/editors like Fuck'n Dabbu and his ilk, first need to familiarise  themselves about the current available historical information on Kamboj history-only then can they qualify themselves to edit the serious articles on the Kambojkas?'.And, I'll see how long these ignorant, prejudiced-minded idiots can continue to block me from editing articles on  Wikipedia?????''.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
You have been blocked from editing for a period of 31 hours for your disruption caused by edit warring and violation of the three-revert rule at The Amazing Race 21. During a dispute, you should first try to discuss controversial changes and seek consensus. If that proves unsuccessful you are encouraged to seek dispute resolution, and in some cases it may be appropriate to request page protection. If you would like to be unblocked, you may appeal this block by adding the text  below this notice, but you should read the guide to appealing blocks first. Bbb23 (talk) 
I love how two editors can gang up on a third, including being so nasty that one of them draws a block for incivility, and it's me who ends up getting fucked by their bad faith actions. Excellent evidence for the proposition that when you give anyone a little power they'll abuse it. Great decision. Spot fucking on. Buck Winston (talk) 
[edit]Hmm

(Non-administrator observation) I've only taken a cursory look at the article, but it looks like you made a good point - I can only think of a handful of shows to have featured three gay characters in a season, and I'd agree with you that it should definitely be put in that category. Regardless, if you plan on making more edits like this and this, you might find yourself with a block extension. Bbb23's a good administrator, and 3RR's called """"bright-line rule"""" for a reason. And considering that edit-warring blocks are to get users to cool down, if this is how you responded, it looks like he made the right call. — Francophonie&Androphilie;(Je vous invite à me parler)

 The various local government areas pages only list them.  I was thinking something like that.  These three paragraphs are from a couple of papers I wrote, they can be incorporated into the article.  

The states (and territories) run the majority of the government in Australia and devolve some of this power down to local government, local councils.  Because this devolution of power happens on a state by state basis, in different states, the local councils have different powers.  Though generally they provide water, sewerage and look after local roads, with the states looking after health, education, police and so on.

Tasmania, like the other states, has a constitution.  Unlike the Australian constitution the Tasmanian one is simply an act of parliament, as such to change it requires no more then a majority in the parliament, not a referendum.  This constitution (among other things) establishes local government in Part """"IVA - Local Government"""" (Tasmanian Constitution).  However, this part while establishing the fact that councils will exist, leaves open how they are operated and what their powers are.  Both the system and power of the councils being provided by the """"Parliament ... from time to time"""" (Tasmanian Constitution).  It is the """"Local Government Act 1993"""" (referred hereafter to as either the 'LGA' or 'the act') that currently provides for the creation of the various councils, the role of the councillors, what power the councils have and so on.  

The act requires that the various councils """"provide for the health, safety and welfare of the community"""", """"represent and promote the interests of the community"""", and """"provide for the peace, order and good government of the municipal area"""".  Generally the act permits councils to """"do anything necessary or convenient to perform its functions either within or outside its municipal area"""".  Specifically, the act provides for the various councils to have the following powers (among others): to charge land rates, """"service rates"""", special rates and to levy fines (in relation to by-laws); and, to make by-laws in respect to anything the council has power to do.
 I'm sure the other states have similar legislation.   (Fuck you!) """,0,0,1,0,0,0,True

 Hey What's Up 

Hey Pink Floyd guy,
I started editing on Wikipedia just to keep my mind occupied, I'm going through deep shit, when I started reading the factual errors and the sick shit like mentioning mortality, dying and suicide on the prognosis section of anorexia nervosa, I started contributing out of altruism. 

Wikipedia occupies the first spot on most searches, for self righteous, incompetent dickheads ( can I say that or am I violating WP:Dickhead?) to claim ownership and disseminate bullshit is wrong, it makes Wikipedia look bad and more importantly people are getting bullshit information. 
There is one particular individual who seems to clamor for attention, his 15 minutes of fame went to his head. All the articles he created are one sentence to a paragraph long. To up his """"look at me"""" count he merely transferred sections that other people created to make it look like an article he started. I read extensively about him, he is a publicity hound and I find his behavior pretty frigging disturbing. Soooo I'm not going anywhere. I just have to cool out with my childish hissy fits and use the WP:Blah Blah and according to WP:Yadda Yadda B.S. 

My life is a bit of a horror show right now, so I might not be able to edit anything after tonight, but don't let a dickhead screw-up what could be meaningful information for other people. Proper knowledge can help people, like your information on Rumination syndrome. Whether or not some dick (WP:Dickhead?) has a college degree or is a physician means squat. I'm going to undue some damage tonight, I think there was useful information on some of those pages if I can't get back for a while don't let dickheads fuck it up. (Can I say fuck it up?)

Cena = Gets too much shit from people for no reason. He can't control the way he is booked. I just believe they should stop pushing him before everyone hates him way too much or just turn him heel which would work for me.

Batista = Whines too much about his position in the company and should shut his mouth. Fuck him, job him out to JBL. I use to like him but he has main evented more than Cena and is in a better position than he should be just because of Triple H.

Orton = Does whatever the fuck he wants because he is a main star and friends with Triple H. Should have been fired already for smoking pot in front of everyone. If it wasn't for Triple H, he would be jobbing in TNA right now. Fuck him, that son of a bitch does not deserve the spot he has. He is good of the mic but ring skills lack, headlock after headlock. They compare him to AJ Styles which is a joke in my opinion since AJ has pure wrestling ability.

Triple = Been playing politics for years and deserves to become a jobber for the people he has buried. He tried to keep Booker T and Kurt Angle down. Angle is one of the best wrestlers and if you watch his match with Abyss at Turning Point; which I can give you a link, it is worth the watch trust me; is still doing great things. Booker T deserved a hell of alot more than he did in WWE. I can't stand him and I hope he gets hit by a car.

 Will Arbitration finally be needed to stop the bigoted attacks?  

I fear that certain editors here have not heeded the recent warnings whatsoever and are proceeding full steam ahead with attempting to make this Bible article a full fledged one-sided POV job, with insulting, inflammatory, and derogatory rhetoiric being directed at all those who take this story seriously.   There is only one way to get this travesty to end and that is with more level of arbitration.  We know there are anti-Christian and anti-Jewish bigots in the world: always have been, no doubt about that.  Why do we have to allow them to come here and spout their intolerance non-stop. The way these sad sacks look at Christians and Jews whom they always label with derogatory sounding labels like """"fundamentalist"""" and """"conservative""""  is reminiscent of the way Hitler felt about Jews except these mental dwarfs include Christians as well, involving a much greater proportion of the population as their target.

Those links to forums on the movie page ARE biased to the point that they attack and /or delete ANYTHING and ANYONE who says so much as """"I think this movie could be done better"""". and YOU idiots ALLOW AND ENABLE IT! the dumbass supporters of this flick throw childish fits anytime anything they don't aggree with is said, spouting off with such classic bullshit lines as """"SHUTUP YOU HATING CRYBABY"""".

Plain and simple - Live honorably, or die by the sword.

Once I have more time I will reduce your Pashtun nationalist POVs here on Wiki and give order to my uncles and cousins the execution of Pashtuns in the entire northern Afghanistan down to Gardez, Jalalabad, Lashkargah, Logar, Paghman, Laghman, Kunduz, Herat, Farah ... whereever immigrant descandants of violent Kuchis settled and took non-Pashtun lands away and traditional Tajik countries. When they have no clue about the percentages they write Pashtu, Dari and Uzbaki are spoken by 90%. So if they know that immigrant Pashtuns are in majority, why don´t they give any numbers? Why Kunduz province is dominated to 56% by Persian-speakers? Go take a visit to Kunduz and see it with your own eyes and listen with your own ears... but I can not tell you you will survive that as a Pashtun. 84.59.190.210
