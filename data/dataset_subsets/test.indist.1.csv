b423cb3d74575d11,"Games veroorzaken wel/geen geweld 

 Schuld geven aan games voor geweld en moord vind men te ver gezocht. 
 Er is veel gediscuseert over het feit of spelletjes nou wel of geen geweld veroorzaken. 
 Er zijn een aantal mensen die hun vinger wijzen naar games als er wat ergs iets gebeurd. Neem bijvoorbeeld het vuur gevecht op een van de scholen in Amerika. In het USA Today’s  Story stond dit: “John Ashcroft was quoted as saying that video games teach children how to shoot, and that violent entertainment, in his opinion, can indeed be blamed for school shootings like Thursday's in San Diego, which followed yet another school shooting in Santee, California.” 
 John Ashcroft een Amerikaanse politicus die zo iets beweert kan veel weerwoord verwachten. 
 Veel mensen en deskundige vinden dat je niet de schuld aan de games kan geven. Als er een drama gebeurt zoals op de school van Amerika is er wel meer aan de hand met een persoon dan dat hij alleen een spelletje heeft gespeeld. Ze moeten eerst goed onderzoeken hoe de persoon in elkaar zit die zo iets heeft gedaan. Er wordt teveel gekeken naar wie de schuldige is als er zoiets gebeurt. 
 Als het zo is dat gewelddadige games verboden moeten worden zou ook alle gewelddadige films en muziek van de markt gehaald moeten worden. 
 Het zal wel zo zijn dat gewelddadige spelletjes een ontsteking brengen bij mensen die psychologisch er erg gevoelig voor zijn., maar om dan alle schuld aan spel te geven dat is niet logisch. Het zou ook niet eerlijk zijn om voor die kleine groep mensen alle gewelddadige spellen te gaan verbieden. 
 Op dit moment is er nu ook een ratingsysteem op alle games aanwezig. Dit wil zeggen dat niet alle spellen verkocht mogen worden als je niet de juiste leeftijd ervoor heb. Toch ondanks het ratingsysteem verkopen veel winkeliers toch hun spellen ondanks ze niet de juiste leeftijd ervoor hebben. Als deze winkels erop gepakt worden kunnen ze een hoge boete verwachten. 
 Er wordt dus wel wat aan gedaan om gewelddadige spellen uit de handen te houden van mensen (kinderen) bij wie wat sneller een ontsteking kan ontstaan. Het is dan ook de taak van de ouders om deze spellen uit de handen van hun kinderen te houden.  

 Bron: 

  

 
 Beïnvloeding op kinderen 

 Uit onderzoeken is gebleken dat een kind niet snel het verschil tussen werkelijkheid en media kan onderscheiden. Kinderen worden al beïnvloed als je s’avonds een verhaaltje aan hun voorleest. Als kinderen tot 9 jaar gewelddadige spellen gaan spelen kan hun dit zeker wel beïnvloeden. Een kind kijkt namelijk heel anders naar een game dan een volwassenen dat doet. Het is niet zo dat dit meteen betekend dat een kind de handelingen die in het spel worden verricht na gaat doen in de werkelijkheid. Een kind ziet op het moment van het spel spelen niet snel of het om echte personen of om computeranimatie gaat. Door het feit dat een kind het verschil tussen media en werkelijkheid niet snel door heeft kan het een schokkend effect  hebben als een kind een gewelddadig spel speelt. Door deze punten is er een ratingsysteem op elk spel aangebracht. 

 De ChristenUnie houd zich wel bezig met het bespreken of geweldadige spellen wel of niet uitgebracht mogen worden. Er zijn een hoop mensen die in de christenunie zitten die zeggen van het moet verboden worden, maar ook een hoop die het willen toestaan.

 Just made some grammatical adjustments to the article about your father. He sounds like a very interesting person as are you. It would be great if he would take a serious look at Wikipedia. The more professional scientists we get onboard the better! 

  
 As i know that you are trying to get others of your professional standing involved in this project i would like to offer as a member of the public some thoughts for those who are skeptical of such a project.  

 All too often the general public is left out of contributing to discussions of scientific importance as we are considered by the scientific community in general to be ignorant and unqualified to engage in any meaningful dialogue about scientific issues of importance. If indeed the assumption of ignorance is true then in my opinion it is a fault of the mediums in which scientific knowledge and datum is transmitted i.e. specialist publications, newspapers, television and to a lesser extent radio. These mediums offer no chance of a dialogue to develop between the general public and the specialist scientist. Instead they are in the case of T.V., newspaper and radio the transmitters of spoon fed facts that we have no control over and renders arbritrary those facts in relation to the world we live in.  

 However with a medium such as the internet and a project such as wikipedia their thus arises a new dynamic between the learned and the layman in that a person with no knowledge of a specialist subject can enter into a dialogue with a specialist and comment on what has been written offering advice to elucidate and make clearer the subject for the general reader. The empowerment that is garnered from this relationship cannot be underestimated as it can have in my opinion many side benefits such as a less alienated relationship to scientific knowledge, a greater appreciation of the information being conveyed, a willingness to actively learn more about the subject you have been involved with.  

 If scientists truely want to engage with the public and have what they say be understood then they must actively get involved in having a dialogue with them, Wikipedia in my opinion and experience to date is a great opportunity to do this.  1 July 2005 00:34 (UTC)",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

 Sentence by sentence analysis of WP:MOS segment that is being misused 
 Most Wikipedia articles should consist of prose, and not just a list of links. 
 *However, this articles is not more made up of lists than other region pages 
 Prose allows the presentation of detail and clarification of context, while a list of links does not. 
 *This prose is just a clumping of the list and the amount of content associated with each part of the list 
 Prose flows, like one person speaking to another, and is best suited to articles, because their purpose is to explain.  
 *Not in this case. It was mostly just the list without the flags and spaces with a reference turned into a comment and with two prior statements fused and misplaced (referring """"The People's Republic of China and Iran are also observer members of the organization"""") 
 Therefore, lists of links, which are most useful for browsing subject areas, should usually have their own entries: see Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists) for detail.

 How can I communicate with this user if I cannot post on his/her User:talk page? I will NOT disclose my personal e-mail to him/her since that violates my privacy. 

 He/she deleted my 3-4 different edits on the Cannabidiol page in one singular edit without first reading my edits. He/she only said that I had to read WP:MEDRS and that Wikipedia does not use primary sources as evidence. I had already read WP:MEDRS and it says WP """"generally does not use primary sources"""". Basically, primary sources can be used but only in a proper way. I had mentioned the use of the primary source in my edit notes. 

 I re-posted much of it on the Cannabidiol:Talk page and justified my positions. Only one post used a primary source, but in an effective, non-biased that only suggests there is evidence that supports a conclusion, but more inquiry is necessary. 

 I feel the need to challenge him/her directly because his/her deletion edits are destructive, irresponsible and disrespectful to other users. It took 4 hours to construct and edit those separate posts and he/she deleted ALL of them, forcing me to have to sift through all the information instead of just reverting my posts individually and only the posts that violated some policy/rule.  

 Why do these assholes get protection while creating a dictatorship on information while people with useful and personal in-depth knowledge of a subject get shot down? Can I block this user from harassing me?
