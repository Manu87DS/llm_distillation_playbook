 A while back, I put out a call for input into the Peirce entry from Peirce professionals. Are your very recent and very extensive additions to that entry in response to my call? 

 I am an economist, not a philosopher by trade, and so am NOT qualified to do what you are attempting. I was first drawn to Peirce by his logic. Believe it or not, I do not find pragmatism very interesting. I cleaned up the references, and am quite comfortable with the details of Peirce's life, having studied Brent's bio. As the article now stands, I am responsible for most of its content outside of section 2. A fair bit of what I did was to revise extensively the shabby prose I found 2-3 months ago. 

 I am intrigued by the semeiotic, but by no means can claim to understand it well at all, even though I own a copy of Liszka (1996)! I became fascinated by how Peirce had more serious experience as a scientist than any other philosopher in the canon. Very recently, I have been trying to come to terms with his system of 3 categories.  

 One would suppose that Americans, by virtue of their national history, their economic conditions, and their intensely pragmatic outlook (I submit that the profession truest to the American character is engineering), would not be well disposed to speculative philosophy and to any metaphysical reasoning whatsoever. In other words, I once believed that philosophy in the USA would have unfolded very much along the lines of what Quine would have preferred. But Peirce shows that that has not been the case. Moreover, Peirce was Peirce all while being a serious scientist and a splendid logician. 
 
 It is also to Peirce's credit that he attracts scholars whose writings and personalities I very much like: Max Fisch, Ken Ketner, Arthur Prior, Arthur Burks, Hintikka, Nathan Houser, Peter Hare, RIchard Robin. Peircians are a happy robust lot.",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Please reconsider your addition of the saltire to this infobox in this light: no other Scottish or UK university infobox uses this image.

 ** Permission from the University to use material in Wikipedia is not sufficient for the text to be used.

Such licensing permissions must be lodged with the Wikimedia Foundation in accordance with the procedure at Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission. 
 ** Secondly, the material is less than ideal in tone.  Phrases such as """"a lively community of enquiring practitioners"""" and """"[w]ith enthusiastic staff and close external partnerships, the school is at the forefront of learning and teaching opportunities"""" read more like a prospectus than an encyclopedic article.  I'm sure that we could do better in terms of providing a neutral, informative description of QMU, without infringing on their copyright or using their own words. 
 * Image:QMUC.gif, the old version of the logo, is currently being used for purely decorative purposes on the article.

 પૃથ્વીરાજ ચૌહાણ પર ઓછી વયમાં જ પોતાની બે રાજધાનીઓ દિલ્લી અને અજમેરની સાથે વિશાળ રાજયની જવાબદારી આવી ગઈ હતી. પૃથ્વીરાજના પિતા સોમેશ્વર ચૌહાણના મૃત્યુને કારણે પ્રજાની દેખરેખની જવાબદારી પૃથ્વીરાજે ઉઠાવી. પૃથ્વીરાજ ચૌહાણ વંશના અંતિમ પ્રતાપી સમ્રાટ હતા. તે પોતાના સાહસ અને પરાક્રમના કારણે લોકોની વચ્ચે જાણીતા બન્યા હતા. પૃથ્વીરાજનો સંયોગિતા સાથે પ્રેમ પ્રસંગ પણ ઈતિહાસમાં ચર્ચિત રહ્યો છે. પૃથ્વીરાજ ચૌહાણનો જન્મ 1168માં થયો હતો. બાળપણમાં જ પૃથ્વીરાજે ગુરૂકૂળમાં રહેતા શસ્ત્ર વિદ્યા, રાજનીતિ કલા અને સાહિત્ય જેવા વિષયોમાં નિપુણતા મેળવી હતી.  

 પૃથ્વીરાજનો સમકાલીન હતો, કન્નોજનો રાજા જયચંદ્ર.. રાજા જયચંદ્ર પૃથ્વીરાજનો મામેરો ભાઈ હતો. સંયોગિતા જયચંદ્રની પુત્રી કે પાલિત પુત્રી હતી જેનુ હરણ કરીને પૃથ્વીરાજે તેની સાથે લગ્ન કરી લીધા હતા. આ એ સમયની વાત છે જ્યારે ભારતની સીમાઓ પર ગોરના શાસક મોહમ્મદ ગોરીનુ આક્રમણ થઈ રહ્યુ હતુ.  

 મોહમ્મદ ગોરીએ ભારત પર આક્રમણ કર્યુ અને તે જીતતો ગયો. જ્યારે એની જીત પૃથ્વીરાજ ચૌહાણના રાજ્યની સીમા સુધી આવે ગયો તો પૃથ્વીરાજ ક્રોધે ભરાયો. ગોરી સાથે લડવા પૃથ્વીરાજે સેના તૈયાર કરી અને બંને તરાઈન નામની જગ્યાએ એકબીજા સાથે યુધ્ધ કરવા લાગ્યા. પૃથ્વીરાજે તરાઈનના પહેલા યુધ્ધમાં ગોરીને પાછળ ભાગવા મજબૂર કરી દીધો. પૃથ્વીરાજની જીત થઈ પરંતુ બીજા વર્ષે 1192માં ગોરી ફરી મેદાનમાં આવ્યો અને આ વખતે જીત ગોરીની થઈ. પૃથ્વીરાજન બંદી બનાવવામાં આવ્યા. ગોરીન વિરુધ્ધ લડાઈમાં જયચંદ્ર મદદ કરતા તો બની શકતુ કે વાત જુદી હોત.

 પૃથ્વીરાજના દરબારી કવિ અને મિત્ર ચંદબરદાઈએ 'પૃથ્વીરાજ રાસો'માં જણાવ્યુ એ પ્રમાણે તેઓએ લખ્યુ કે જ્યારે પૃથ્વીરાજ ગોરમાં બંદી હતા ત્યારે એકવાર હુ તેમને મળવા ગયો. ત્યાં સુધી તો મોહમ્મદ ગોરીએ તેમને આંધળો બનાવી દીધો હતો. ત્યારબાદ મેં અને પૃથ્વીરાજે મળીને ગોરીને મારવાની યોજના બનાવી.  

 એક દિવસ જ્યારે પૃથ્વીરાજને દરબારમાં લાવવામાં આવ્યા તો મે 'ચાર વાંસ ચોવીસ ગજ, અંગુલ અષ્ટ પ્રમાણ/તા ઉપર સુલ્તાન છે, ન ચૂક ચૌહાણ' કહ્યુ. આ અંદાજથી પૃથ્વીરાજે શબ્દવેધિ બાણ છોડ્યુ અને મોહમ્મદ ગોરીનુ માર્યો ગયો.  

 ઈતિહાસમાં લખ્યુ છે કે મો. ગોરીનુ કોઈ તેના દુશ્મને હત્યા કરી હતી. ગોરીનો કોઈ પુત્ર ન હોવાથી તેના એક વિશ્વાસુ ગુલામ અને સિપાહી કુતુબુદ્દીન એબકે ભારતમાં ગોરી દ્વારા જીતેલ રાજ્યને દિલ્લી સલ્તનતનુ રૂપ આપ્યુ. અને ગુલામ વંશનો નીવ મૂકી. આ રીતે પૃથ્વીરાજ ચૌહાણની હારથી ભારતના ઈતિહાસને વળાંક મળ્યો.

 But for now, our inflexible policy is to tag all templates right on their bodies. No exception is made for templates that are highly visible. Indeed, it could be argued that in such cases, it is even more vital to be sure that the largest number of users become aware that the nominated template is, indeed, up for deletion.  

 Please do not remove the prescribed tag from the nominated template until a decision has been made to retain the template. Thank you. —  09:18, 2005 Apr 7 (UTC) 

 == Let it be == 

 ::I have come to believe that {tfd} is entirely unnecessary and a menace to the project. I have not recently tried to alter the TfD process itself  as you have done  without the consent of others. I have merely nominated for deletion a template which I find is useless, dangerous, unattractive, and boring.  

 ::How big is this fight to you? You have attempted to reopen debate on {divbox}. Shall the matter be permitted to fester indefinitely? We have a policy and a workflow, and thus far, it has not been subject to edit war or seriously rude debate. Thus far, discussion has revolved around the proper place for, and for that matter, need for, {tfd}  the tag itself, not the process. And the debate over {divbox}, while not harmonious, ended without anybody screaming at anybody else that {divbox} was the anti-Christ, or its nomination for deletion equivalent to genocide.  

 ::Seven days is as long as a template is allowed to sit and stew; after that time, it is free to go peacefully. Do you want to call that into question, too?  

 ::As for tagging Template:Tfd, I'm sorry: {tfd} is not above the law. It is a template like any other, subject to all the same rules and the same level of scrutiny. You don't like what happens when it is tagged for deletion? Sweat it out like every other poor bastard with a dog in the fight. With any luck, a sudden surge of support for its deletion will not come in at the last minute, and you can then correctly remove the tag from the template, archive the discussion, and breath freely for another month.  

 ::Proposing Wikipedia:Votes for deletion itself for deletion is not relevant, or even illustrative. The action of nominating Template:Tfd for deletion does not call into question the page, Wikipedia:Templates for deletion. I think it's obvious that they are two separate and independent pages. Nor does the process of TfD depend inevitably on the tag {tfd}. For one, I have offered a new tag, , which is far more suitable for our purposes, as well as more attractive; for two, I am hardly convinced any tag at all is desireable; I am now leaning toward direct notification.  

 ::I despise threats, and I do not begin with you. Please allow me to believe I have given you sufficient notice that I view your recent actions in the harshest light. Despite all appearances of solidity, Wikipedia is a tiny, fragile ship afloat on a raging sea of chaos. We do not need to begin to violate policy simultaneously with editing that policy. It would take only a small number of sufficiently angry users to drag this project to a screeching halt. This is not a threat of mine whatever; but something I fear the subhumans will do if you  and I  give them sufficient cause to believe that the rule of common sense in harness with customary procedure no longer holds.  

 ::To risk annoying you with repetition, I am not threatening you: I will do such-and-such if you keep fooling with the way things are done. I am sharing my fears that if we persist in slugging it out, then our fight  together with the dozen similar feuds raging in one corner or another of this project's infrastructure  will eventually corrode and bring down the entire project upon our heads.  

 ::Let it be. I'll bet Netoholic will, too, if you do. He's too smart to go that far out on a limb. Let {divbox} go; and when its seven days have expired, I shall allow {tfd} its freedom, too.

 The article cites as fact Rothman's doubt that Young actually carried out his experiment, spending a considerable amount of time on that issue.  It would be helpful to know who else doubts it besides those who accept Rothman on blind faith.  Repeating isolated theories as fact runs the risk of filling Wikipedia up with half-truths shouted at full volume.  One could then sympathize with the man who wanted to charge $10 per printed Wikipedia article, who when confronted with the statement in Wikipedia that it is free replied, """"You believe everything you read in Wikipedia?"""" 

 If Rothman is right about the experiment not having been performed, we would have the interesting situation of someone who, in a culture totally wedded to the corpuscular theory of light, guesses its wavelength and then describes a gedankenexperiment that if carried out would demonstrate quantitatively the wave nature of light.  To accomplish this without actually doing the slit experiment, he or an accomplice would either have had to carry out some other experiment yielding that information involving for example Newton's rings (in which case why would he not report that experiment instead?), or be visited by a time traveler from the future.
