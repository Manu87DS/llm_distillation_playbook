 == Full Rewrite == 

 Cluebot just reverted an IP editor's """"full rewrite"""" as possible vandalism.  While, I think ClueBot was probably wrong to call that vandalism, it was definitely not an acceptable edit.  I just wrote the following on the IP's talk page, but figured I should post it here to so that others can see and we can have centralized discussion if needed.   
 ::First, before completely rewriting an article, I strongly recommend discussing it on the talk page.  Second, your new article was highly POV, which is not allowed per WP:NPOV. Third, it didn't even fit the meaning of the page. That is, while the attacks against women (the sexual violence) may be an example of some Hindus being violent against non-Hindus, that definitely was not terrorism, because it was not an intentional act by an organized group to cause terror to another group.  I strongly suspect you are one of the people involved in the now deleted article Hindu jihad, as I recognize a number of the claims.  That article was deleted for clear reasons; unless you can fix the fundamental defects in that information, please do not attempt to re-add it elsewhere.  It is possible that one or two of your sources and sentences could be incorporated into Saffron terror, but not the whole article. Please discuss any further comments on that article's talk page. 
 So, if anyone wants to discuss those edits, feel free to do so here.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,"```json

This month long discussion we are currently in, is the only serious discussion of changing the lead that has been proposed.  The language re: the number and names of the investigations was placed in the lead sometime in late 2006/2007. In September of 09, someone replaced that language with """"Oswald is the assassin"""", which instituted a discussion that lasted half a day.  I replaced that edit with the language that was there until Rudioso showed up about a month ago.  The point in relaying this history is that the edit history does not support that there has been some longstanding feud about the language of this introduction or that mentioning the investigations will somehow allow these discussion to continue.  In fact, the actual history tells us that the only time objections arise is when editors change it to state Oswald is the assassin.  Rudioso is the first and only editor who's objected to the statements of investigations since it's been introduced.  Now, I'm all for trying something new, but I think that since none of the proposals have garnered the support required to claim a new consensus it is best that we go back to what was there before Rudioso briefly objected.  That version clearly had consensus, something that no new proposal has garnered.

 :Hi ! I agonized a bit over the title, to be honest, and despite the WP:BOLD move I am quite open to suggestions. I admit I dislike """"Count"""" because readers will probably assume that he was a count of the sort encountered in Western Europe, whereas this is a simple local gubernatorial title, copied by Bulgaria from the Byzantines. And per WP:NCP titles or positions should not be part of the article title, unless they are part of the clear WP:COMMONNAME, e.g. Empress Matilda. There is AFAIK no conclusive evidence on usage however; although a number of prominent English-language writers (Curta, Fine, Treadgold, Jenkins, Whittow) use """"Count Nicholas"""", it is not predominant usage, at least from what I have seen. I've seen the transliterated Bulgarian form """"Nikola"""" used alongside the Byzantine form """"komes"""" by a Bulgarian author (Antoljak in Samuel and His State), for instance, and any other possible variation (the great Obolensky for instance eschews the title altogether). Stephenson's usage, which you point to above, would probably """"support"""" the current name, i.e. a person named Nicholas, who held the office of komes. As I said, I have no strong preference, and would even accept """"Count Nicholas"""" on the strength of the authors cited above, but somehow I feel it is too weak a basis. Unless you have a better overview of the literature, then the best thing would be to ask for a WP:RM to establish consensus among interested editors.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,"```json

Please, stop being angry for a moment and consider what you're doing. You've done the equivalent of posting """"there was no rationing in the USA in World War Two"""" when you weren't ALIVE then. Now, millions of people are going to know that what you wrote was wrong, and that it's only remotely likely that you wrote it in good faith. Even if you seek out material about World War Two as little as I seek out material related to porn, a normal person open to everyday experience is going to know, as background knowledge, that there was rationing in the USA during World War Two. Just like you know the RED light means """"stop your car"""" and the green light means """"okay to go"""". It's part of the background facts of life. Now let's suppose one Wikipedia reader who was an adolescent during World War Two administers to you a well-justified pasting on the Talk Page of that article. The appropriate response from you should be """"Okay. You were there, I wasn't. I don't know what I'm talking about. I've only READ BOOKS about it. I didn't LIVE through it. What you know is better than what I know. The PROBLEM is, my good sir, that in order to change the gist of the article, we just have some rules about how to introduce the statements that show that there most assuredly WAS rationing in World War Two. We can't just attribute it to your personal memory. Now, it's rather unfair of Wikipedia to ask YOU to do ITS job, so someone at Wikipedia will respond to your complaints by chasing down the evidence that shows that rationing did exist during World War Two, and will then rewrite the article using this evidence that meets Wikipedia's rules, which only we understand, rather than throwing that burden in your face and making you spend a year learning the rules that apply to Wikipedia. You've pointed out that we were spreading untruth, and we will correct it. Thanks. It's like when you hear Marvin say something and you know Marvin wouldn't lie, you STILL can't testify to the truth of what Marvin said (only that it's true that he said it) because the Court and the Jury don't know Marvin and have no business believing Marvin to be incapable of lying, even though YOU might be justified in so believing. Now Marvin said this, and we know it's true, but we have to find ANOTHER way of introducing the truth of the fact other than that Marvin said it. Okay? I'm not accusing you of saying something that's not true. I'm just saying we have to find another, more acceptable way to introduce it as true, other than your say-so on Marvin's say-so.""""

From 1580, the Viceroy of the Cantonese province had established biannual 'trade fairs' lasting several weeks, at which Chinese and Westerners exchanged ideas and goods. The interchange between East and West was intense just at the moment when Chu Tsai-Yu went into print with his new theory. It is a case of perfect timing which gives one the feeling that it was 'meant' to happen. We do not know the exact mode of transmission of the idea to Europe; there can be no doubt that Western music was to be totally conquered by the Ming prince, for within fifty-two years of Chu's publication, his ideas were published by Pere Marin Mersenne.

 == What the Bleep are ya all Upset About? == 

 The movie is a self described """"spiritual"""" film, a typical new age hodgepodge of the usual fun New Age """"quantum"""" hoopla. So? Is it trying to force it's way into high school physics curricula? Junior high school? elementary school? Nursing homes? Police academies? Breakfast cereals? Whats the big bleepin' deal? 
 How 'bout this, my fellow eggheads. What does the average viewer of this film wind up knowing about quantum mechanics (or neurology, or whatever) after leaving this film. On average, nothing. Which is exactly what the average person on the street (POTS, for you Lieber enthusiasts) knows anyway. So I ask yawhose fault is that (if we must assign blame and point fingers)? I'll tell ya thisyou can no more blame that on Ramtha than you can on Mothra. However, it would be perfectly fair to point a few fingers and toes at the perfectly lame state of science education in our land. Oh you say, thats true, and it's the evil Bush's fault. Think again. Where exactly are the scientists who should be fighting this battle with the fervor of the great crusades of human history? (given that many of you seem to think that a movie such as this harkens the end of snivelization as we know it.) Take a look at the (very many) popular tomes on quantum mechanics on the shelves, and what do you see? Simple, straight ahead, humble elucidations of concepts that anyone can get a handle on if properly motivated? But nooooooooooooo, we get wannabe science celebrity rock stars further muddying the muck with tales of Wild Quantum Wierdness That Is SO Weird We'll give you Some Watered Down Version But Only Us SMART GUYS (women eggheads like Janna Levin and Lisa Randall are a lot easier to take in this respect)  can REAAALY Get IT (and that dude from the NY Planetarium too is better too). So relax people, have some fun, get down with your 50,000 year old bad selves! 

 ===such a wickedly great post I had to create a separate section for comments=== 

 This goes into my hopper as one of the finest posts I've seen on Wikipedia...   

 But I do have a complaint about the knock on us guys. Some of the smart ones get married to really hot genius gals like Joel Primack's wife Nancy Abrams, and they go off and write really fun stuff together about Lurianic Kabbalah and such. Or Heinz Pagels and his hottie Yale divinity scholar wife Elaine Pagels. What I wouldn't give to see transcripts of thier pillow talk. Whoooo...can't go there.    

 : Good call, WNDL42. Another way to put this in perspective…this article was viewed a whopping 630 times in January. Now that might seem like a whole lot, until you consider that 625 of those views were undoubtedly by y'all edit warriors. Meanwhile, a humble and uncontroversial article about an old pioneer road in Oregon racked up 746 views. So yeah…cool it, guys. Stop wasting all the pixels! -   

 :: Yup, this has to be the biggest tempest in the smallest teapot that I've ever seen.   The idea that any rational person could read ANY of these versions and conclude that the science in this film is accurate is ludicrous.    

 While I tend to agree that the amount of effort put into this article has been out of proportion to its importance, it doesn't seem reasonable to me to say Well, the film isn't important, so we can let the article about it be bad. Some of the leads above are pretty short and sweet and don't give any false credence to the film. I really don't understand why people fight for versions that are artificially favorable towards the film. If we simply put out lead that summarized the view of the film taken by reliable sources, it comes out pretty negative. If people would accept that, write the lead that way, and stop trying to portray new ageism and mysticism as credible, the argument would be over.
