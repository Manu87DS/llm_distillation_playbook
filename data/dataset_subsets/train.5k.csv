 Confused about how members are selected 

I'm a bit confused how the members are selected. I know each has to be approved individually, but how exactly are they nominated (self nominated?)? Are only the appropriate number for each region nominated or is it possible to have more then the total allowed for a region nominated? If it's possible to have more then the total, and more then the total are approved, how exactly are the states which will actually be on the council selected (e.g. based on the votes received). Finally, whatever the case, what happens if not enough states are selected/approved from a region?  

I hink that they are self-nominated because there were more candidates then mandates to disperse.  

To address your questions in order:
They are all self-nominated. The countries have to volunteer, and they have to invite observers into their countries to check how their own human rights record actually is.
It is possible, and intended, that more than the alotted number of slots nominate themselves; else, why vote if we have exactly as many candidates as slots?
As has happened for the Western European and Others Group, the ones with the most votes in support are selected. (None of the candidates from the WEaOG got less than 50% approval, but Greece and Portugal got the smalles number of votes, I believe.)

2b40d3da12a48d29,"""==Author's comments==

I posted the following comments on the userpage, but moved them now to this talk page with minor edits:

The following changes are suggested:

 Mark """"Requests for Adminship"""" as historical, and open the new process, """"Sysop Applications.""""
 Replace the standard three RFA questions with the six questions shown below.  
 Question 3 - how the applicant intends to use the sysop tools - is similar to old question 1. 
 Question 4, asking for the applicant's article writing experience, is based on old Question 2. 
 I have removed old question 3 about conflicts with other users.
 Questions 1 and 2 are added to establish minimum criteria.  Only one user (Lustiger.seth) who failed these criteria has become a sysop in the last several years.  Having these criteria on the application should eliminate the need for WP:NOTNOW closes to premature RFAs.
 Questions 5 and 6 are added to establish the candidate's character for honesty.  Why this wasn't done years ago after the Archtransit scandal is hard for me to understand.  Disclosure of material negative information should be expected of all applicants.
 Remove the old system of voting """"support"""", """"oppose"""", or """"neutral"""" with a reason in your vote.  Instead, vote """"support"""" or """"oppose"""" without giving a reason.  Then, if you choose to give a reason, you may comment in the """"Concerns"""" section or on the talk page of the Application.
 This change will reduce the """"pile-on"""" effect of oppose voting.  Normally, in old RFAs, support voters vote without saying much, whereas oppose voters write long comments.  The oppose votes are disorganized insofar as oppose vote number 13 may refer back to oppose votes number 2 and 6.  The cumulative effect of oppose votes with long reasons is to say """"we hate you.""""  
 The new model removes this asymmetry.  You can still oppose, but you can't say more in your oppose vote than a supporter would say in her support vote.  The cumulative effect of bare support and oppose votes is """"some of us like you, and some don't.""""  To the extent that reasons for opposing the candidate need to be explained, the voter can explain in the """"Concerns"""" section.
 No """"neutral"""" votes.  If you don't want to vote, nobody is forcing you.  Neutral votes are pointless.
 We can decide later what a passing score should be.  For now we can allow bureaucrats to use their discretion as they currently do.

The following features will be maintained from the old RFA process:
 Bureaucrats decide the outcome after a 7-day discussion.
 A nominator may praise the candidate.  That is probably the one positive aspect of old RFA that is worth preserving.

Nope, I didn't read the guide to appealing, didn't have time. The user in question IS engaged in harassment, I've been doing this long enough to know and I can prove it. He/she immediately placed a threatening notice of blocking me permanently on my user page, reverted the article while I was in the midst of editing it (my second pass, couldn't even preview changes), then changed his/her mind as to my real wiki-sin, since the onus for proving the Doris Day available as PD on archive.org was on him/her not me and the usual span for pre-Bern had expired long ago, ... decided my REAL sin was Original Research (oh noes), and continued to revert based on that. Does OR add clutter? Sure it can, but if the user in question was REALLY concerned about that, about the quality of the article and about extraneous details, WHY DIDN'T HE/SHE EVEN NOTICE two paragraphs already there, comprising about 1/3 of the entire article, dealt with Norman Schwarzkopf, an unrelated book and an unrelated ice cream store name? I'll tell you why: the user wasn't engaged in good-faith/goodwill editing and the normal back-and-forth that leads to better articles. He/she was involved in blocking input to the article. Why? Was it personal against me, or was it to preserve the existing content of the article, including the false claims and extraneous material not even concerned with ther subject at hand? I can only speculate, but I'd guess it's some sort of power trip and wiki-bullying. I don't really have time for this. I have made a fair number of very good edits over the years and have usually refrained from saying anything that isn't directly related to content and improving articles. I could pretend this user didn't do what he/she did, but I'm wasting my own time here and I don't really have a stake in any such pretense. I don't have any stake in improving this article either, no dog in the race, I just see how it can be improved and made more informative. As a long-term wikipedia user and editor, I don't see any problem in jumping in and fixing something. I almost expect some sort of pushback now, but not over completely minor edits which are very good and on-target in very minor stub-like articles. The problem isn't me here, it's that if people such as the user in question can get away with this sort of behavior, and they are getting away with it, wikipedia becomes a much poorer place, a playground filled with bullies rather than a library where we can all learn and share. Also, I don't recal ever having called him/her a bot, I think you put those words in my mouth, perhaps inadvertently. His/her behavior is malicious, but probably not malware, just the normal human collection of problems. I think this user should be warned against trying to be a gatekeeper, he/she isn't quite qualified for that at this point anyway, and it's having a very chilling effect across wikipedia. I won't egnage in a battle of the wikipedia rule acronyms, I will continue to write in English, and to read articles on wikipedia in English, and to think of ways to improve them in English. I am fully aware of how the terms """"vandlism"""" are used and misused here, and most of the rest of the wikijargon. Nothing new under the sun here. If you read the edits I made carefully, and note the times of the reverts and the history of actions by that other user, you will see I'm not off the mark here at all. I know what's going on. I don't know why, but I don't have to, and I expect the motivations aren't interesting. Respond if you have anything to say.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

I was not rude to the editor, but I was treated in a condescending and arrogant manner over a very minor matter

This user seems to be on a campaign trial on behalf of UKIP'. This is called blatantly misleading other editors, surely in violation of policies such as WP:AGF, WP:BITE, WP:CIVIL and WP:NPA. I have nothing to do with UKIP. I am not a member of any political party. I am not enrolled to vote in the United Kingdom. So these are ludicrous allegations. I have created 21 pages, 16 non-related to the elections. Articles I have created such as Endorsements in the United Kingdom general election, 2015 are very important and been widely edited and viewed. I have also created articles such as United Kingdom general election, 2015 (Wales) in accordance with precedent. I have worked hard on the project for good and in good faith. Examples: List of European Union member states by GDP growth and Mr Galloway Goes to Washington. I have successfully nominated dozens of articles for speedy deletion. As a new editor, I am deeply upset by how hard it is to edit this site without abuse and being treated like a moron (WP:BITE).

What did I say that was uncivil? Mellowed Fillmore said 'It is my view that AusLondonder is clearly not here to build an encyclopedia. He is likely to remain a problematic editor and I'm not sure that any more patience needs to be shown' - yet I have created 27 pages  including Endorsements in the United Kingdom general election, 2015 and List of European Union member states by GDP growth.

My two main suggestions are to make smaller improvements to the article and to use more than one source. Unless you are very skilled at proper paraphrasing, using a single source greatly increases the risk of close paraphrasing, i.e. improper paraphrasing, and also leads to a very one-sided view of the subject. I've added two reference to the article with links to their pages on Google books (most of which are visible, at least in the UK). The print copies may also be in the Longy library:
Marco, Tomás (1993). Spanish Music in the Twentieth Century. 
Draayer, Suzanne Rhodes (2009). Art Song Composers of Spain: An Encyclopedia
The previous reference I had added—Romero, Justo (2004). Liner Notes: Joaquín Turina (1882–1949): Piano Music, Vol. 1—is also very useful, especially for discussing his musical style and works chronology. I suggest you use these as your sources for further expansion with the biography on joaquinturina.com] as a back-up only.
 
One thing you could do is separate out the last paragraph (beginning with """"His works include..."""") with its own heading Music and expand the commentary there. For example, he was a very noted composer of art song, which is given short shrift in the article. Much has been written about his approach to incorporating Spanish musical idiom in his work and on his style in general, including its strengths and weaknesses. This is also lacking in the article.
 
Another possibility, is to separate out a section at the beginning of biography to Early years where you discuss his family background and his musical education prior to Paris. The material between that section and Music could be entitled Paris and Madrid and can always be expanded in the future.
 
A third possibility is to expand and rationalize the list of works in the article. The current one has three major problems. First, it excludes many of his important works because it relies solely on those scores available at IMSLP. Secondly, it gives no indication of each work's type. Thirdly, it gives no indication of the date of their composition. Listing them alphabetically, is not a good way to go. If you do decide to concentrate on improving the works list, I suggest using List of compositions by Claude Debussy by genre as a model, although in this case, the list would not be a separate article, but rather continue to appear in the Selected works section of Joaquín Turina.

Here is how the New York Times commented on the 1993 tax exemption: 

The landmark reversal shocked tax experts and saved the church tens of millions of dollars in taxes. More significantly, the decision was an invaluable public relations tool in Scientology's worldwide campaign for acceptance as a mainstream religion. On the basis of the I.R.S. ruling, the State Department formally criticized Germany for discriminating against Scientologists. The German Government regards the organization as a business, not a tax-exempt religion, the very position maintained for 25 years by the American Government. 

I think the NY Times writer clearly expresses the view here that the US abandoned their earlier view of Scientology as a business, as still espoused today by Germany. 

Note that the State Department Report referred to in the NY Times article is the """"Religious Freedom Report."""" The Religious Freedom Reports for Germany have discussed discrimination against Scientologists by the German state almost every year since the IRS decision, referring in 2006 for example to """"certain religious minorities, notably Scientologists"""". 

Following the 1993 IRS decision, the IRS wrote to foreign governments, appending a document entitled """"Description of the Scientology Religion"""" to their letter and stating that various Scientology organizations had demonstrated that """"they were organized and operated exclusively for religious or charitable purposes and that no part of their net earnings inures to the benefit of any private individual."""" 

Media references to the """"Scientology religion"""" (and similar references to Scientology as a religion) are common. 

The Encyclopedia of American Civil Liberties says that """"Despite its legal setbacks, Scientology has achieved full legal recognition as a religious denomination in the United States."""" 

As for the claimed inability of any governmental entity in the United States to determine what is or is not a religion, the United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, stated in a 1992 decision that """"Indeed, the IRS itself has stipulated in other cases that the Church of Scientology is a bona fide religion.""""; so in the view of that court at least, the IRS has been quite capable of making such stipulations. 

The St. Petersburg Times wrote in 1998 that """"After a 40-year battle, the IRS dropped its tax dispute with Scientology and declared it a tax exempt religion in 1993.""""

The criticism that fanatic skeptics extremists have of it is that, while the difference between acupuncture and no treatment is very very large in every case, the difference between acupuncture and so-called """"sham"""" acupuncture is small, sometimes even clinically insignificant.

But this phenomenon makes total sense when we take into account the fact that this """"sham"""" acupuncture is not analogous to placebo at all, but in fact is strikingly similar to a very authentic traditional style of Japanese acupuncture (shallow needle insertion/non-penetration, alternate acupoint and meridian location, etc) that has been in common use for centuries are is still widely practiced to this very day.

The fact is, acupuncture is effective, and its silly to even try to test it against a placebo in the first place, because its not a pill or a drug or a substance that lends itself to such methodology. 

So what if some of acupuncture's effects originate in the mind? TCM theory itself states that, in therapy """"the mind leads the qi, the qi leads the blood"""", indeed predicting itself the main criticism that fanatic skeptic extremists have against it.

Its time to realise that Chinese Medicine is a valuable body of knowledge and lore, and to end the racism and xenophobia that insists that only Western culture is capable of developing an effective system of medicine.

So you haven't done your homework, you refuse to read or listen to the answers to your questions and then you delete the references that have them.  You are quite a piece of work.  What happened to freedom of speech and free open honest discussion where people can be swayed by reasoned thought?

I am curious what all the other wiki editors who have been following this think.  Of course it will be difficult for them to research the sources you have removed and now locked out.  How about that.  

Suggestion: if you were really as honest as you like to think you are, you would put both articles on the page for everyone to read and vote on.  Yours as it now is, and mine as I last left it.

It says in the instruction to new editors to assume good faith.  That has not been my experience of you, and from my point of view, you have now demonstrated that beyond any doubt.
There are other issues here.  Everywhere I look in wikipedia I see poorly written, out of date articles, or articles with messages requesting that someone update them.  I am curious how many others have had similar experiences to what I have had here and who have lost interest and moved on? Does anyone keep track of wikipedia's hit count and how it has changed over the years?  Or the number of active wiki editors?  I wouldn't be surprised one little bit to find out it both have leveled out and gone into decline.  If so, has it occurred to you that that might be a signal of some sort?
This issue also points out another major flaw in wikipedia; the fact that a single admitted non-expert in a field of study can override multiple experts from NASA, Lockheed Martin, JPL, etc., on a topic as you have done here. 

You have some serious issues here.  I will be interested in seeing how you resolve them, assuming that you can.  Or will this article remain as it now is, another stone in the constipated belly of wikipedia, for years to come?

I just had an idea.  I am going to put the article as I last left it right here so that the other wiki editors who have been following this can read and compare without editorials from either of us.  
It will be interesting to see if you have the courage to leave it alone and allow others to form their own opinion and do their own research.

A skyhook is a proposed space transportation concept that aims to reduce the cost of placing payloads into space. 

Skyhooks are often confused with an Earth surface to geostationary orbit space elevator, but they are different.  A skyhook is much shorter than a space elevator and does not reach down to the surface of the Earth.  A skyhook requires a suborbital launch vehicle to get to the bottom end of the skyhook, a space elevator does not.  Due to the much shorter length of the skyhook and the resulting reduction in strain, skyhooks up to 4,000 km in length can be built with existing materials, while an Earth surface to geostationary orbit space elevator cannot.Amanda S. Wu, Tsu-Wei Chou, """"Carbon Nanotube Fibers for Advanced Composites"""", Materials Today, vol. 15, July–August 2012, pp. 302-310   

The advantage of a skyhook it that the lower end of the cable is moving at less than orbital velocity for its altitude.  As a result, a launch vehicle flying to the bottom of the skyhook can carry a larger payload than it could going directly to orbit on its own.  When the cable is long enough, single stage to skyhook flight with a reusable launch vehicle such as a spaceplane becomes possible.  Reusability of the launch vehicle and an enlarged payload fraction makes for much lower launch costs.   Once the cable has become long enough the skyhook becomes cost competitive with what is realistically thought to be achievable using a space elevator (assuming a space elevator can ever be built), and the skyhook can be built.{{cite jour",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

This particular case is a little more complicated because I think it’s a sock puppet, i.e., using more than one identity to create illusion of support or to evade final warnings and the like. In that case, they can be reported here, but I think you’re supposed to monitor the suspect first to make sure it’s recent violations and so on.

From the point of view of the Italian Fleet, the battle definitely wasn't a """"substantial victory"""" to the Italians in any way. 
However, almost all sources agree that, had the Italian Battleship and Cruisers remained at anchor, or had the Italian ships failed to make contact with the convoy, the British delivery of supplies would be completed according to schedule, namely, before sunrise. This disruption of the Royal Navy plans, along with the damage inflicted upon the escorting units, made the cargo ships an easy prey for the German and Italian torpedo-bombers the morning after the battle. 
The only cargo ship to make Malta undamaged by the bombs was the Talabot, largely overdue from the original timetable. All the other were hit in some degree by axis aircraft BEFORE reaching the harbour (not just Clan Campbell, which means that the Royal Navy was still responsible for the steamers fate), further hampering the escorts effort to disembark the supplies in time. 
So, despite the remarkable skills of the British units to save the merchantment from an attacking Battleship, the naval engagement should be considered a marginal victory to the Italians. 
On the other hand, had the British deceived their enemy or in some way avoid major contact with the Italians and reached La Valetta at dark, yes, the Royal Navy success would be undeniable.

    To understand where Rich is right now is just half the equation, the other half lies in his history. Much of Rich's music tells the story of that history. Born in Riverside, California at just 15 years old his journey began. It was Rich's deep rooted love and passion for music evolving from a family of musicians, which really allowed him to turn his life around. This turnaround was despite all the trials and tribulations of his youth, while residing in Moreno Valley, California.
 
   Once in Seattle, Washington Rich embraced hip hop and rap music as well as the culture. Rich realized thru listening to the lyrics of others that he could really relate to what these rappers were saying. That is when Rich knew he too could share all that history he had bottled up inside thru his own lyrics. This is when hip hop really took over his life. Rich's level of musical development exploded, so he then channeled all his energy into writing and producing his own music. Rich is a producer and creator of addictive melodies, with beat wizardry that captures his audiences’ attention. They become mesmerized by his verbal versatility with stories, outlining and defining his truly most turbulent times.
 
   In 2003, Rich established a Washington, D.C. Metropolitan based Management, Production and Promotions Company called; HardHead Records. This brings us back to where Rich is today, HardHead Records has now commenced an exceptional business network with key associates in the music industry.

Dear all! Thanks for the warm wishes and all the emails that came in while I was at the New Year's vacation.

Now that I checked back for what has been going on in the last ten days while I was away the situation seems hopeful indeed. The bunch of scandalous action inspired by the secretive plottings are still being discusses and widely condemned and I see I see a strong momentum of the community of the Wikipedia editors to finally put a decisive end to the secretive activity at the closed channels followed by the drastically insulting onwiki actions. I am also hopeful that the new arbcom will act on the recent developments.

Space disposal
I've been on a rampage today, looking for stuff that needs to be completely redone. So I rewrote the section on space disposal. It no longer contains any speculation on the feasibility of space disposal using technology that hasn't been created yet. More importantly, it now refers to a reliable source. I hope I haven't hurt anyone's feelings but it really needed to go.   
Thanks. These are people who nearly had seizures when we launched Cassini at Saturn with a few kg of Pu-238 in it. Even if we had a magical propulsion system for launching actinides into space for free, I doubt that politically people would tolerate the booster failure risk rate. If 1% of these things are going to fail and go into the ocean, why not just include the other 99% as well, while we're at it? ;). At least if you pick your spot, you can drop casks into ocean crustal subduction zones (which has been suggested).

The link you provide states that """"45% of the rail market in Sweden is privatised"""" that therefore makes saying """"Rail transport in Sweden is privatised"""" a falsification if more than half of the entire market is still owned by the government. It doesn't matter whether the rail market was """"liberalised"""" into different companies under state ownership e.g. SJ, something cannot be described as """"privatised"""" if it retains a majority of government ownership, because it is therefore nationalised, the opposite of privatisation. To describe the Swedish rail market as privatised and then list a state owned company which comprises it in the very same sentence is nonsense and this is exactly what you have written.

""""Rail transport market is privatized and companies include SJ.........."""" - In this sentence you have made it sound as if SJ is a private company which is untrue, since if the person reading clicks the SJ hyperlink, they will be taken to an article which states unambiguously that SJ is a government owned enterprise.

A much better thing to do would be to explain that the majority of passenger transport by rail in Sweden is operated by state owned companies such as SJ as well as the government run Lokal Trafik in place within each of Sweden's Län such as HallandsTrafik, Storstockholms Lokaltrafik, SkåneTrafik etc. etc. etc. and THEN to explain that some sectors of rail transport are privatised such as the transport of cargo. This would therefore align the content of the article with the reference you presented above, which states that the majority of rail transport in Sweden is still government owned (with 45% being privatised).

Since judging by your other edits you are a right winger with a serious beef against anything government owned, you could then satisfy yourself by writing that state owned SJ isn't the most efficient of rail networks, something which a lot of Swedes themselves agree on as far as I have seen. In my own experience delays are common and travelling with SJ can be expensive.

939a3642bac41f5d,"""I am not sure. If the word """"denialist"""" is new (which it is), you are unlikely to find a source calling an organization 100 or 150 years ago """"denialist"""". You might find all the characteristics of what denialism is of course. 

It depends on how you define denialism. If we define it very narrowly, we will only end up with 1 or 2 topics in the category of denialism, which clearly is wrong given the similarities of human behavior in those one or two areas with those in other subjects. 

I believe we should do what dictionaries do when they define a word: we look at prominent sources like the New York Times, the New York Review of Books, the London Times, the Economist, the Wall Street Journal, Academic  journals, scholarly writing, popular novels, etc to see how the word is used. For a new word, this determines its meaning, until a family of dictionary editors codifies this set of meanings as a family of different definitions that are published in dictionaries. Since we are not yet at the dictionary publication stage, but at the earlier pre- dictionary publication stage, we have to do more of the hard work ourselves. That is all. 

It is clearly a common word, in common usage, at least in some subject areas. One rarely hears the word """"AIDS denier"""" although that is essentially what an """"AIDS denialist"""" is (parenthetically noting that in fact an AIDS denialist is really an """"HIV denialist"""", properly speaking). And I suspect the phrase """"Holocaust denier"""" will fade from usage now that the new word """"denialist"""" seems to be gaining popularity. 

If one maintains that there are two separate groups, denialists and deniers, then why are there no AIDS deniers? Why no HIV deniers? Only denialists? Seems a bit strange, given that human behavior is not much different in all these cases; only the topic changes. The denying stays the same. 

If putting someone in a denialism category constitutes libel, then a very large number of publications worldwide have put themselves in legal jeopardy by publishing articles on AIDS denialists and other kinds of denialists. Given that these publications have full time legal staff and large legal budgets, and the people making these claims on Wikipedia are not lawyers or legal experts, this claim seems dubious at best. 

If we accept the gratuitous personal assertions of some that denialism is really a political movement that involves personal gain, then creationists, creation scientists and intelligent design promoters fall in this category. If """"denialism"""" is more like denial of the evidence, then this is less obviously true, since there is a dispute about the evidence in these cases. 

If we define """"denialism"""" as some here claim, to only mean those that know they are lying about the truth, then where does that leave the most common usage of the word in the phrase """"AIDS denialism"""" ? It obviously cannot mean """"lying knowingly"""" in this case, or probably in all cases. 

I suggest that if one requires a publication to directly make the claim that """"X is a Y"""", to put some article in a category, then we would depopulate most of the categories on Wikipedia. If Y has characteristics {Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4...Yn} from dictionary definitions or from common usage, and this common usage is well-understood and evident from publication in WP:V and WP:RS sources as defined above, and if X has most if not all of the characteristics {Y1, Y2, Y3...Yn}, then surely X can be put in the category Y. 

For example, suppose we define a new type of urban area called a """"Townlet"""", being an area with a common administration within a radius of 5 kilometers and a permanent human population of 5000-10000 people. Then one surely does not need a publication to state that """"Filllsberg is a Townlet"""" to put Filllsberg, meeting all the necessary criteria, in the category """"Townlet"""". 
 
I also vehemently deny the assertion that """"denialist"""" is a singularly negative category and so should not be used. If so, we would get rid of a large number of categories, such as """"pseudoscience"""". 

Also, as I have stated repeatedly, """"transhumanists"""" or """"secular humanists"""" or """"aetheists"""" might be viewed as denialists by some. And might feel perfectly proud to proclaim themselves as denialists of some overwhelming belief or putative evidence. 

For these reasons, I think there is nothing wrong with having a category called """"denialist"""", or """"denialism"""". The membership of this category might be controversial, depending on what we take as the definition of the word. Any particular subject might or might not be put in that category, given community consensus on the word's definition, and on the individual case by case analysis of any particular topic, subject or article.

Failing to keep everything up-to-date
Hey Guys,
I seem to notice that we I'm absent, NOT all of the stats, season summaries for teams, etc. are staying up-to-date. Take for example Richmond, their season summary has not been update even since I been overseas in Europe. I mean that I feel stressful that I'm the only one updating Collingwood's season summary and nobody else. Also with season summaries, I want to discuss with all of you about how if we should have ALL of the season summaries in either a list or Template:AFLGameDetailed form (I might already dicuss this here).  Another problem is that Wikipedians has been updating articles in various formats in which it really annoys me when I update stats myself. e.g. With the Win/Loss table, I seem to notice that some Wikipedians have NOT bold the margin e.g. """"Port Adelaide 138"""" rather than the preferred format """"Port Adelaide 138"""". I notice that one lazy Wikipedian has decide to only update the Win/Loss table for their favorite team () rather that both teams ( and ). I mean the whole idea is to keep the article up-to-date, it is? Speaking about updating in various formats, I seem to notice the ladder progression gets messy and untidy all of the time. I means that we should discuss this problem together on this page and settle down on ONE simple format that all of us Wikipedians can follow. One Final thing I want to talk about in this is NOT changing/removing that already occurred in the past, I mainly notice that with the Win/Loss table were vandals keeping removing the bold text with home teams and sometimes with the Ladder were people make up they own stats. Its drives me insane and people must start looking at the Ladder on the offical website here in order to update the Ladder on Wikipedia. I hope that you fellow Wikipedians take me seriously on this issue as I am finding it stressful enough updating many stats myself.
Thank you for your attention.

 My signature and your actions ~  

I thought about taking this to a dispute hearing, but I couldn't be fucked.  So, I'm just going to outline here why I think that your blocking of my account was unjustified and against policy.  

You stated when you blocked me, """"anon. only, account creation blocked) with an expiry time of indefinite (personal attack in signature - will unblock on signature change"""" .  I disagree with your action on three levels.  The first is that it was a personal attack, the second on the indefinite ban, and the third on any action at all.  

 Why it wasn't a personal attack 
""""The primary purpose of creating any block is to protect Wikipedia and its editors and users from harm."""" (From WP:BP).  Of the list of reasons, on WP:BP the only one plausibly applicable is """"Disruption"""".  Under this it has 

""""A user may be blocked when his/her conduct severely disrupts the project — his/her conduct is inconsistent with a civil, collegial atmosphere and interferes with the process of editors working together harmoniously to create an encyclopedia.""""

And """"Blocks for general incivility are controversial"""".
In no way could any of my actions be considered """"severely"""" disruptive.  Or even simply disruptive.  While it could be argued that my signature was generally uncivil (and I disagree, more later), blocking for this reason is controversial and should have been discussed first.  So, from WP:BP there is no reason (in my opinion) to block.  

Now we examine WP:NPA.  This is simply, """"Do not make personal attacks anywhere in Wikipedia"""" and I agree with it.  The point here is """"personal"""".  My signature was not a personal attack on anyone.  It was a generalised comment and an """"in joke"""" (I can't help it if you are not in on the joke).  For the """"attack"""" to be personal, you would need to find someone who was """"attacked"""", you would not be able to do this.  

So, my signature did not constitute an attack on anyone, it did not disrupt discussion or affect the quality of my edits, thus it should not be a factor in anything.  

As to general incivility, I simply disagree.  From WP:CIVIL, """"Whereas incivility is roughly defined as personally targeted behavior that causes an atmosphere of greater conflict and stress"""".  My signature was not """"personally targeted behavior"""" (as explained above), and I also fail to see how it could cause an atmosphere of """"conflict"""" or """"stress"""".  There is nothing in this policy which is applicable in this case.

 Why I should not have been blocked 
In blocking me indefinitely, you violated WP:BP which states, 

""""Established users with significant constructive edits should not be indefinitely blocked except when there is a community ban. In all other cases, they should be handled with appropriate time-limited blocks or arbitration. Indefinite blocks should not usually be placed on IP users (whether individual IPs or IP ranges) in order to avoid inadvertently blocking legitimate users.""""

In blocking me at all, I also feel that you violated WP:BP.  You did not have a clear reason to block me, and you did so indefinitely.  In these cases, you should have posted at WP:ANI asking for advice and/or detailing why you felt that the block was needed.

 What could have happened 
So, what could you have done?  Well, the simplest thing would have to post on my talk page a comment asking me to change my signature and pointing to the policy which it violated (see the previous case for an example).  If you had have done this (and I had agreed with your argument) then I would have simply changed my signature.  If I had failed to change my signature, then you could have discussed it with me more, and/or taken it to a hearing.   

 Conclusion 
As I said at the beginning, I didn't want to take this to a hearing.  However, I feel that I would be perfectly within my rights to do so, and I reserve the right to do so.  This, by the way, is simply a statement.  

What would I like you to do?  Well, an apology would be nice, perhaps something worded along the lines of """"I'm sorry for not talking to you first, not checking policy and for violating policy by indefinitely blocking you"""".  

If you are unable to give an apology (for whatever reason, say you believe that you were in the right and still are), then I would appreciate a comment regardless.  

A comment on my userpage would be noticed faster, but here would be fine as well.

RfC: Incompatibility between the standard scientific notation for paragroups, and links 

Standard scientific notation for paragroups is to use an asterisk after the name for the haplotype. The very conciseness which makes this a very useful standard, reduces its usefulness as a link
Therefore, currently, there is no standard for both noting a paragroup, and usefully linking to the paragroup article which explains this distinction, without saying, Haplotype paragroup, which in my limited understanding seems to be either a tautology or an oxymoron (I told you it was limited)
I fear my option may be marginally acceptable, and I was hoping someone with a better knowledge of the subject might either endorse them or have a better idea
Current status: * The current status. If you missed that, I can't say I am surprised, it is a link shown as * after the colon and before the word, """"The"""" on this line. Paragroups are marked with an asterisk, which is pipe-linked to the redirect page * (haplogroup), creating about 30 or so double redirects

Yet I have the right to feel offended when someone says every single Mormon man is a misogynist who sees every woman as a baby - making machine.  I have the right to defend law enforcement officers against the charge that their hard work consists of gossip.  Maybe they never solved the Kupcinet case, but their hard work has made the world safer for you and me and our parents.  If I were defending an extremist like a Ku Klux Klan member, then I would understand you pointing out that I ain't in the Klan.  But sheriffs aren't extremists.  Some make mistakes and commit crimes, but they are highly regarded by crime victims who get the satisfaction of seeing their tormentors get locked up.

You point out that newspaper articles reporting Dr. Harold Kade's egregious mistakes, one of which put an innocent man in jail for five months, say nothing about Kupcinet, therefore they aren't relevant to her case.  If the articles said he was a careless driver who got off work one night and then crashed his car into a truck carrying tissue samples to another lab for analysis, thereby making that person's death a total mystery, then your point would be valid.  An accident that Dr. Kade might have caused when he wasn't on the timeclock tells us nothing about his competence while he was on the clock.  We know he was on the clock when he put an innocent man in jail for five months. We know he was on the timeclock when he screwed up another case that was unrelated to that unfortunate man.  Therefore his screwy actions while he was working are relevant to yet another mysterious death that he was supposed to solve but didn't (Kupcinet). At least he didn't solve it to the satisfaction of those gossip queens known as sheriffs.  If they didn't cut open her dead body, then they knew nothing, right?  The woman's father didn't see the autopsy, either, and he actually was considered a gossiper by some people, so to hell with him, too.  Right ?

With your cockeyed logic, I can add a comment Richard Nixon made about Robert Kennedy's alleged relationship with Marilyn Monroe to the articles about Kennedy and Monroe, and anyone who adds a few words about Nixon's dishonesty can get banned from Wikipedia for 48 hours.  Nixon did, in fact, make a brief comment about Kennedy-Monroe when he was interviewed for 60 Minutes in 1984, ten years after he resigned.  Video and audio of it exist, but I, for one, never will add it to Wikipedia.  If I did, Wildhartlivie would want a footnote citation that identifies the producer of the segment and what he ate for breakfast on the day it aired.  Someone else would remove it on the basis that as long as it had nothing to do with China, anything Nixon said about others' flaws was a lie. That's good enough for me, but you're just going to say Watergate was a separate entity that had nothing to do with Kennedy or Monroe, therefore Nixon could have said they were both transsexuals and that's legitimate. 

Let gullible kids who read Wikipedia know what that great man said about an emotionally fragile woman he never met.  Your logic is cockeyed.  Unlike Monroe, whose autopsy was performed by a relatively competent doctor named Noguchi, Karyn Kupcinet was permanently screwed up by a klutz. Deal with it.  If you keep banning his klutzines, maybe you can delete the entire article about Jack Kevorkian. How do you know your body will be treated fairly the next time you visit a medical doctor ?  You don't.  If you're dead you don't complain.  Deal with it. Life sucks. People screw up everywhere, even in a room full of fresh corpses.",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

I'm not sure the etymology of the word has much to do with it; the idea of religious police is pretty common on one level or another in almost all Islamic countries. It takes various forms depending on what the government decides to do, naturally; the more religious-theocratic the government, the more likely it'll be a full branch of the police or even its own group. Take its incarnation in Saudi Arabia and compare it to the village enforcement groups found in northern Pakistani villages, for instance. Or the versions in Egypt and Yemen, which have (at least at this point) more to do about making sure that the only version of Islam practiced is the state-sponsored one. Overall, the fact remains that MANY Islamic nations have religious police of some form or another, and leaving out the fact that it is NOT an institution unique to Saudi Arabia is inaccurate, as is claiming that it """"only"""" exists in Saudi Arabia and Iran.

 DEAR Anonymous EE Guy,
 
Well, I don't know if you really mean to give a full picture of the case, but we could include this one:
 
http://perso.wanadoo.fr/leuven/reich1.htm
 
http://perso.wanadoo.fr/leuven/
 
Who are the web site of Jean-Pierre Voyer, a kind of model person for mister Messager/YBM, and who spred a quiet special form for ideologie, which goal is to play with words and how to defend and argue about things who do not exist, how to play with words and """"fuck others"""" as phrased on his web site, and essentialy, how to display a superior attitude in order to effectively use the communication on internet to their full interest, by using the circumstances frame of the dialogues. This include displaying lies as being facts with such a forcefullness as to convince others.
It is called: postsituationnisme, ideologie who is followed by YBM, together with a sympathie to the 3rd reich, and a, by some, called pseudo-Hégelianism.
YBM run his forum where he defend the man and his positions, with as much furore as he dispells those of Igor and Grichka Bogdanov.
You will found in it concepts as the Superior Race, versus the inferior race, and different creativs ways to talk the technics and language of publicity into a way of """"mass communication"""" and a weapon to convince anyone of anything.
 
I am sure that this angle will bring a certain shade of light where it was upmost needed, and will constitute the missing piece of the puzzle.
 
I hope you will excuse my very late assertion or révélation about this subject, but I was myself only made aware of it for a very short time ago, together with the fact that this Voyer and YBM have harrassed people before, writers too, for books who had nothing to do with science, but nevertheless constituted those 2 mens lifes mening for 2 years.
Actually they stopped with their first victims at the end of 2002, beginning of 2003, to consacrate their cherish technics of manipulating the masses, and ideologies of diffamation on 2 other subjects, Igor and Grichka Bogdanov.
 
No need to say that the 2 former victims are still paying for the vices of Voyer and Messager, and that their lifes and career have been destroyed.
 
Why so much hate against people they didn't knew and had never met?
They were only practicing, like serial killers start somewhere, in the shadow, and are only known for much more exposed actions.

Here are some other links who do compleete the picture:

YBM Web site:

Site Voyer:
http://perso.wanadoo.fr/leuven/reich1.htm
http://perso.wanadoo.fr/leuven/

I consider this information for being central in the matter at hand, as all accusations will have fallen and nothing much will have come from the original and following J. Baez paper on the subject if it hadn't been for Messager and Voyers' questionnable work in the name of very questionnable motives, all accomplished to serve a completely useless ideology.
I think that this will teach us all a lesson regarding objectivity and our hability to evaluate a given problem properly, and to be able to use our sense of sceptisisme ans sound judgement.  On a more general way and even more central here, our power to distinguish between agreeing to a given opinion based on facts, and being manipulate in doing so for all the wrong reasons.
 
This information compleete the picture and gave it its true mening, even if it is by showing how meningsless a huge part of this affair was.

As a matter of fact, I think there here there are two problems:

according to what you wrote, the name of the peak refers to the Treaty, not to the village; so it should go under the Treaty of San Stefano voice.

here I answer with an example: according to your philosophy, in the voice Rome there should be a list of the (about) 53 settlements, mountains, and so on, which take names from the eternal city. This makes no sense, but make sense to write on each single voice about its etymology.

You're conflating issues here. This is not an assumption of bad faith; it's adhering to what the source actually says. William M. Connolley's extemporaneous comments here are not a source; the publication (RealClimate) is the source.

This is just a frank evaluation of what the source says; RealClimate says nothing about who worked on the article or how it was written, but we know that unsigned """"group"""" pieces are often not equivalent to joint authorship. For another analogy, consider per curium legal opinions. """"Per curium"""" means that all of the judges or justices agreed, but it's a very different thing from all of them signing the opinion. Typically, they're less controversial cases, so one judge's clerk writes the opinion, then they're circulated for comment. But the other judges typically don't scrutinize it as closely as if their name was on the line; there are many examples of judges railing against dicta that they theoretically endorsed just a couple of years earlier—sometimes even within the same case. Unanimous opinions (where every judge signs) are different, and they reflect a higher level of collaboration, as in Brown v. Board of Education.

Armenians got encourge with Russia and France, These countries came and help them. Armenian gangs mostly  were foreign and encouraged the local Armenians. It became a civil war. Armenians and Turkish groups were attacking each other. If you were the decision maker, how would you stop this? Answer is reallocation. The only solution was reallocation. I am not saying old woman and childeren were supposed to immigrate but you can not know who supports Armenians gangs, right?...  'disorganized revenge killings' happened at both side. Ottoman was not strong enough to organize these kind of reallocation.. In fact they were very poor and they had some Armenian causalities during this migration. 19:02, 14",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

To claim that what isn't relevant? I agree with the suggestion of including some criticism of the term. As I have said repeatedly, the passage from Gardner does not criticize the term """"non-Aristotelian logic"""". It addresses a different use of the word """"non-Aristotelian"""". This by itself seems like sufficient reason to remove it. Furthermore, its current use in the article blurs the line between the two senses of """"null-A"""".

This is the point where the nonmuslims invite the wrath of All muslims

Nonmuslim nations are weaping about terrorism and they are giving wind to the fire in muslim hearts burnt due to these type of PICTURES displayed on the sacred Artical of Muhammad (PBUH). The day is near when muslims will take revenge. From the history we have seen that ARABS and NONARABS have slayed their children in the name of ALLAH nad MUHAMMAD. So if the writer of this artical MUHAMMAD and the pictures includer thinks that he is giving a good idea of getting knowledge, he/she is obviously on wrong path. Respect to get Respect, more over LIVE AND LET LIVE (basic peaceful Muslims psycology). There is a need of education among Nonmuslim nations especially cristians who have no path to live, in tension they are running here and there to get shelter but, let us see in next 2 decades they are building such a mountain for them which they cant handle. THE Discussion is to long and i have lot more points, i dont want any one to opt the orders but to """"DO LISTEN"""" and think a way out.

SO PLEASE DO NOT CREAT PROBLEMS FOR YOUR SELF. """"IF NATIONS LIKE ARAB SOUTH ASIA WILL COME TO KNOW ABOUT THESE PICTURES ABOUT WHICH MOST OF MUSLIMS ARE UNAWARE THERE WILL BE A VERY BIG PROBLEM"""".

If USA, Allies want Pakistan to become what they think then make islam happy Pakistan will get into there clutch. more over the point to restore peace in AFGANISTAN AND IRAG the common man in pakistan is more intelligent than the think tank in USA. since i have been to lot more places i think that policy needs to be completely revived i dont want the powerful nation to enforce a world wide civil wars and revolutions. In Muslims there is nothing except Faith in ISLAM. They always unite in time of need and the internal hot talk in every streat of pakitan is integration of all the sects and nations named muslim

looking forward in anitcipation.

Remove these Pictures and become safe please do not get on to the war and kill and get Killed in the hand of muslims and let us become your friends.Muslims have Faith in JIHAD nonmuslims has no term like that as basic piller of religion. One way what i propose is very safe...

 Lead is too narrow 
The lead states """"Adherents of the 9/11 Truth Movement deny that al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked four airliners and intentionally crashed two into the World Trade Center buildings"""". I think this is too specific, as not all proponents argue this. Some (engineers particularly) only claim that the towers were brought down with the help of explosives without any assumptions as to who was involved. The use of explosives doesn't preclude Al-Qaeda (or anyone else) from hijacking (or otherwise) airliners (or aircraft of similar description) from intentionally crashing into the WTC. It seems fairly obvious that aircraft flew into the buildings, but that also doesn't preclude the use of explosives. I'm not a die hard truther, but I don't belive the mainstream media or the US government either. As a structural engineer there does seem to be some quirks in the hypothesis put forward by NIST, and the apparent hasty destruction of material evidence from the disaster does seem very questionable. Calling for further investigation doesn't seem unreasonable regardless of what actually happened. There seems to be a lot of people who get offended even by the mere suggestion of further investigation (which may in fact help to clear the government of any involvement). I guess these people (who seem to get all their 'facts' from Fox and CNN) explain why the US government is able to get away with gradual erosion of liberties (PATRIOT, NDAA, TSA, etc).

Potential and kinetic are a very general classification of energy forms. As stated in the present version of the article, these are mostly useful in mechanics. Based on the fact that a photon has no mass, the equations that are given in the present definition of kinetic energy are not applicable to electromagnetic radiation. I must say I agree with Andries. Also, this article is part of an encyclopedia. Why should it be limited  to the basic definitions of kinetic and potential energy forms and I see no reason why we are trying to associate energy forms as to being only potential or kinetic. I like the work done by Bensaccount, but I think it needs to be elaborated. Electrical energy, for example, has both forms of potential and kinetic energies. According to """"Principles of science"""", 1966, the most common forms of energy are mechanical energy, chemical energy, heat energy, sound energy (compressional waves), light energy (electromagnetic radiation), electrical energy and nuclear energy. I think if someone would like to expand on these it would be benificial to everyone.

There is a difference of approach between my sandbox article and the english and french wikipedia articles (I intend to integrate the material in my sandbox article into the english wikipedia article.)

I believe that an encyclopedic article that features a mathematical treatment should focus on the derivation. In the material that I have prepared the mathematical treatment starts with first principles, and subsequently works its way towards the equation of motion:

Once the equation of motion is formulated the physics has been taken care of, and I proceed no further.

I find the treatment in the current english wikipedia article and in the current french wikipedia article unsatisfactory in the following way: the mathematical treatment merely states the equation of motion; the physics taking place (coupling of oscillations) is not discussed.  | Talk",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Poor merging of planned films into the main list of films, because trying to sort by """"Story Order"""" screws up the table badly
""""Reception"""" was stolen wholesale from Star Wars; this redundancy is unnecessary, and the section can be linked to in the """"See also"""" section

 Alawis 
hello im new to this and dont quite no how i would send you a message through this? 
but how would we be able to discuss the Alawi page? 
i found some things that you were tryin to explain be incorrect. Every Alawi person i no Woships the Imam Ali in the Shia way, and worship all of the Prophet Mohammads family, and the we worship both the Prophet Mohammad and the Imam Ali, and follow both their teaching, we do not just follow the Imam Ali teachings, we follow the Prophets as well. Alawi int he past 50 years have become closer to Shia, and do not celebrate Christmas. Or any other Christian Eids. I know from me and my family we celebrate all Shia Eids, and for Ramadan nearly every year we choose to fast. And yes our teachings are kept private (not secrete) —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)   
Well, we should probably discuss this on the talk page on the Alawi article, but anyway, I believe the Alawite beliefs vary quite a bit, my family do for example celebrate Christmas and other Christian festivals, but they are Lebanese, so they may have retained more of the original Alawite beliefs than the ones in Syria, who try harder to be accepted as true Muslims, so that the validity of Bashar Assad's presidency isn't questioned.    

My family is Alawi, and we celebrate the Shia Eids. We dont celebrate Christmas how can we, when we dont believe the story of the 3 wise men, ad we dont believe in Joseph, to Muslims Marry wasnt married and God had sent """"Zacaria"""" to guard her.et c 
The part about How we Worship the Imam Al, to Alawi we follow both Teachings of the Imam Ali and the Prophet Mohammad. None of them come first, in your case your kinda saying that Ali comes first before the prophet. Alawi only have the Quran and their own scriputres as Islamic text. And iv read from other websites that Aparantly Alawi worship the Imam ALi like a God, when we dont. When you are trying to Explain the Trinity thing, your as basicly saying that we belive Ali is God, in 3 forms, which complely contridicts the point of us being Muslim. That there is no one but Allah and there is only One god, and he has no sons etc. And we believe in Rencarnation as is. And your should say that when the boys study the Alawi text, you should say after 15/16 boys can choose to go deeper into the relgion and study more, or choose not to study more. i no from my grandfather he went deep into the relgion and spent his whole life studying it. Where as my dad stoped when he got married and had kids (so around 22). 
Well, I didn't write the article, and I'm not sure who added the trinity stuff, but if it isn't sourced, it probably shouldn't be there. As for beliefs, well, as I mentioned before, the Alawites in Syria have changed their beliefs to become more like mainstream Muslims, so many of the older traditions might not be practiced there. It's different in Lebanon though, where the Syrian government is unable to regulate the sects like in Syria.

You raise several interesting points.

On the matter of plagiarism in general: Yes, you're right; if a Wikipedia page is remarkably similar to a page elsewhere, that doesn't mean that the WP page plagiarized the other: it could have been the other way around, or something more complex may have happened.

On this page: Its history shows an almost uninterrupted growth to this state, before the trimming started. I haven't examined the growth, but yes, gradual growth (as opposed to sudden jumps in size) suggests that the editorial work went on here. So perhaps I was too hasty.

Here is Graham's page about himself. I now notice that it says at its foot Excerpt from Gallery Press Release, 2008. So it's possible that it copied the press release which itself was a copy of the WP article.

So maybe I have an """"overly critical attitude"""". But if so, it's an overly critical attitude toward the editing, not Graham's work. (I've seen some of his early work from Beyond Caring and think it's very good; I know little about his other work.)

Why the apparent concentration on Japan? First, it's hardly a concentration; it's simply the addition of a sourced fact. And, if you're interested, here's how it came about. Having created Category:Photography in Japan, I populated it. Racking my brain for non-Japanese photographers who'd done a significant amount of work in Japan was a pleasant activity for a commuter trip or three; I also emailed a couple of friends more knowledgable about the matter than I am. Graham's name came up, either to one of them or to me. I was certain that he'd done work in Japan so I put this in  in accordance with WP policy, backing up the assertion with a reliable source. 

This was a contribution of time and energy, though admittedly a tiny one. Graham's work seems to have many admirers. I was hoping and expecting that among themselves they'd rebuild the article. I'd be willing to help with this. While not working on Graham's article, I've been working on articles about other photographers.

So let's turn back the clock to September 2008, before the cuts. Here's a paragraph:

Graham was the first photographer to combine the sensibility of contemporary colour photography with classic British social documentary. In 1981/2 he made A1—The Great North Road, a book of 40 colour photographs taken along the length of the British A1 road, which had a transformative effect on the black and white tradition that had dominated British art photography till that point. This work, along with Graham's later photographs of the 1980s -  the colour images of unemployment offices in Beyond Caring (1984-85), and the sectarian marked landscape of Northern Ireland Troubled Land (1984-86) - were pivotal in reinvigorating and expanding this area of photography, by both broadening it's visual language, and questioning our notions of what such photography could say, be, or look like. Photographers like Martin Parr made the switch to colour soon after, and a new school of British Photography evolved with the subsequent colour work of Richard Billingham, Tom Wood, Paul Seawright, Anna Fox, Nick Waplington, etc.

Let's suppose for a minute that this is legitimate WP text, and not ripped off from somewhere else. Its content is a mixture of the easily verifiable and the arguable. Was he the first photographer to make this combination? Did this one book have a transformative effect? Why """"British art photography"""" (my emphasis)? How were they """"pivotal""""? This stuff would have to be sourced. (Yes, writing for WP is a bitch.)

GTBacchus, that is an excellent idea. Indeed, the sources are available (as we have both noted) in the Dresden Firebombing Wikipaedia page, so there's no real dispute about their availability and relevance. The WP:RSs are there for editors to assess in the wiki-link provided.

5af8fa7f5f5417ef,""":Let me first of all set the record straight about the history of the relationship between myself and User:Jza84. On his talk page Jza84 states 'I hardly know the editor bar an passing in a discussion from time to time'. As Mangojuice notes on that same page, 'Jza clearly knows Enaidmawr is a long-time established editor here; Jza interacted with Enaidmawr as early as November 2007, over 6 months before Jza became an admin.' That interaction was courteous and constructive and repeated on a number of occasions. I wouldn't claim that we were regular collaborators, but collaborate we did, and if somebody had aske me, before this incident, 'do you know this editor and do you have a good working relationship with him?' I would have replied in the affirmative, without hesitation. The only real """"edit conflict"""" I had with him prior to this was in February of this year, at British Day. This was resolved civilly and without rancour, although I have to admit that I found his attitude at the time patronising - """"A lesson would be it took all of five minutes to strengthen the article up with a few references."""" - and felt that the zealousy with which he reacted to my edits - an effort to bring balance to a biased account, in my opinion, for what it's worth - whilst ignoring a number of dubious and unsourced statements and peacock terms for the opposing view of the subject, was unbalanced. However, I refrained from comment (see Brit Day in his talk page archive). 'Everybody is entitled to their views', I said to myself, and moved on. I'll admit that I tended to avoid him after that as I had no wish to get embroiled in anything: I've got better things to do. I could have responded to this comment on Talk:Newport which I found to be deeply insulting to all Welsh people: saying that Daicaregos was 'an advocate of """"Welsh nationality"""" (which doesn't exist, verifiabily)(). That statement left me with the indelible impression that Jza84 denied the nationality of myself and all Welsh people. I thought that was a very hurtful comment and completely unnecessary and I am sure that most Welsh people would feel the same way. However, once again I did not respond even though I was part of that discussion and was sorely tempted to do so: 'Ignore it', I told myself. Shortly later I became aware of a series of edits by Jza84 removing Welsh nationality and replacing it with 'British' on a number of articles on my watchlist; amongst them was the article on Dafydd Wigley, Plaid Cymru's senior statesman. Rightly or wrongly, I was by then convinced that Jza84 had a personal agenda on this matter. I reverted some edits and ignored others not on my watchlist as I genuinely did not want to get involved in a dispute (and no, it had nothing to do with his admin status). However, when I saw his edit to Template:Welsh kingdoms, also on my watchlist, I will admit that I was incensed. I reacted with less tact than I should have done, I admit. I reverted his edit. Changing 'Welsh kingdoms' to the woefully incorrect and insulting 'Brittonic petty kingdoms of Wales' seemed to me to confirm my impression of him: it basically de-Cymricised the major kingdoms of medieval Wales, which have a central place in our history and identity, used a term which is both incorrect and open to misinterpretation by the general reader (not everyone is aware of the meaning of the rather obsolete and affected term 'petty kingdom'). He than undid my edit and came up with the wording 'Ancient kingdoms of Wales', which is again quite simply incorrect ('medieval' is not 'ancient'). Then I read his """"explanation"""" on the talk page. Quite frankly I thought he was taking the mickey. It also confirmed me in my opinion that he had an agenda of denying the Welsh people their identity (quote: 'What exactly are the Welsh kingdoms? Kingdoms inhabited by the Welsh?  Well, no, the Welsh are a modern nation who live in Wales. Are they subdivisions of Wales?  Well, also no, these kingdoms pre-date Wales by centuries (Wales was a concept of the future!'). 'What fools historians, Welsh and others, have been to refer to such icons of Welsh history as Llywelyn the Great as Welsh (and his court poets who praised him as 'King of the Welsh' etc.)', I said to myself. At that point I should have taken a deep breath and walked away to make a coffee, count to several thousand and then respond. But I did not, and the result is this. That sets the record straight. I've already apologised for any offense I may have caused and given my opinion of Jza84's decision. I write this to let my peers who have commented and acted on the matter get the 'history' behind this incident from my point of view. I do not intend to respond here to other things which have been said or implied here and at Jza84's page about",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

e07de5cc865c113c,"A typical anti-Ukrainian Russian imperialistic claim 

The current version of the introductory section contains at least one paragraph that is purported to make Ukraine look as a home of all sorts of people, except Ukrainians themselves. Here is what it says, as of today:

 Ethnic Ruthenians were frequently a rural people and often formed minorities in their own cities and towns. For example, Kiev in the 1920s was approximately 1/3 Jewish and 1/3 Russian, with the remaining third constituting ethnic Ukrainians, Poles, and Germans. A similar demographic history existed in Lviv with a majority Polish and Jewish population.

Am I the only Ukrainian editor who finds these kind of statements offensive? Not only these kinds of claims have absolutely no ground in the known Ukrainian historical facts, but they, in fact, repeat, almost word in word, the statements made by anti-Western anti-Ukrainian Putin propaganda!

I asked the editors to provide the citations justifying the obviously false claims in these paragraphs. My requests have been deleted and I has been told that they will block my Wikipedia account. 

 Pseudo-Western editors adding Russian propaganda to this article 
It looks to me that at least this Ukraine-related article has been monopolized by some editors who created Western-looking Wikipedia profiles.

No, consoles do not kill people and yes, it is POSITIVE, but this does not invalidate the fact that it still is something NEGATIVE related to the question.

After the Christian population of the bishoprics of Skopje and Ohrid voted in 1874 overwhelmingly in favour of joining the Exarchate (Skopje by 91%, Ohrid by 97%), the Bulgarian Exarchate became in control of the whole of Vardar and Pirin Macedonia. The Exarchate was also represented in the whole of southern Macedonia. The “Macedonian Question,” became especially prominent after the Balkan wars in 1912-1913 and the subsequent division of Macedonia between the three neighboring states, followed by tensions between them over possession of Macedonia. This partitioning of the territory had a tremendous influence on the development of the Macedonian national identity.Center for Documentation and Information on Minorities in Europe - Southeast Europe (CEDIME-SE)MINORITIES IN SOUTHEAST EUROPE - Macedonians of Bulgaria, pg. 6  In order to legitimise their claims, each of these countries tried to 'persuade' the population into allegiance. Paul Fouracre. Cambridge Encyclopedia of Medieval History Some scientists argue also that the use of any ethnic definition of the Slav speekers in Macedonia during the 19th and early 20th Century did not refer to ethnicity, but rather a socio-occupational description. The Slav population in Macedonia tended to be Christian peasents, farming folk,The Macedonian Conflict: Ethnic Nationalism in a Transnational World - Loring M. Danforth, ISBN13: 978-0-691-04356-2 attested socio-political circumstances, such as in what language the local schooling was provided, or whether the local church aligned itself with Serbian, Bulgarian or Greek Orthodoxy. The majority were under the influence of the Bulgarian Exarchate and its education system, thus in the early 20th century and beyond, were regarded as Bulgarians, whatever that meant.(Brubaker 1996: 153; Ruhl 1916: 6; Perry in Lorrabee 1994: 61)The 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica.

To Inquire into the causes and Conduct OF THE BALKAN WARS, PUBLISHED BY THE ENDOWMENT WASHINGTON, D.C. 1914  However, the key events in the formation of a distinctive Macedonian identity emerged during the first half of the 20th century in the aftermath of the Balkan Wars of 1912-1913 when the Bulgarian Exarchate discontinued its activity in most of the region. The process strengthed especially following the Second World War, with the withdrawal of Bulgarian authorities from Macedonia, the establishment of Yugoslav Macedonian Republic and the signing of Bled agreement. With the founding of the People's Republic of Macedonia in 1944 as part of SFRY, a sense of a Macedonian national identity gained strength and became systematised.(Bell 1998:193) The Yugoslav government began a policy of removing any Bulgarian influence and cementing the Macedonian identity.Europe since 1945.

The association of Afghanistan and """"Ariana"""" for the FIRST TIME IN HISTORY appeared after World War II and this includes the name for their airlines """"Ariana Airlines"""".

I have offered plenty of serious and verifiable examples that shows what you are forcefully injecting in this article is wrong,  but it seems that you are only interested in a stupid and stubborn childish game of just winning an argument at any cost, no matter what the truth is. Tell me which of the following points is wrong:
1- No reputable scholar has ever claimed that Aryanem Vajo is in Afghanistan.  

2- One scholar, the late Professor Bahram Farahvashi, who dedicated his life to Iranian studies and has several respectable publications, including his award winning Dictionary of Pahlavi Language, has a book by the title of """"Iran Vij"""" which is precisely about Aryanem Vaejo which Zereshk claims to be Afghanistan. According to this book, as well as other scholars, Aryanem Vaejo is next to the Caspian Sea.  Farahvashi also mentions the names of the scholars who think (and gives their reasons as to why they think) that Aryanem Vaejo is next to the Aral Sea.  In no case anybody has suggested it is in Afghanistan.

3- In at least three of the Achaemenids inscriptions (by Darius I and his son Xerxes) where they mention the word Arya  (that is, the Old Persian word Arya) in the SAME INSCRIPTION they also mention Haraiva (modern day Herat which was recorded as """"Aria"""" in Greek texts) as one of the provices under their rule.  The two words are DISTINCLY DIFFERENT words with different spellings.  Only due to the Greek rendering of Haraiva as Aria this confusion exists today (and even then, it surfaces after World War II, because someone found a way to associate Afghanistan with """"Aryan"""" and others picked it up.)

4- Unlike what Zereshk claims, Encyclopedia Iranica DOES NOT say that Afghanistan is the same as Aryanem Vaejo nor does it anywhere say that Afghanistan has EVER been called """"Ariana"""".

5- Show me one authentic source from BEFORE WORLD WAR II, that shows any part of Afghanistan has ever been called """"Ariana"""" or """"Aryana"""".  Just one source would be enough, but it has to be an authentic and academically acceptable source, such a book from antiquity or the like, and NOT afghani web sites from the 21st century.  By repeating that the """"official afghanis website says so"""" you only show how weak your argument is.

5- Last but not least, in your revert message you offered the reason [this is] """"the OFFICIAL POSITION of The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan""""  well, that is not good enough.

Yeah, I think I wrote most of that section some years ago (although I didn't give it the heading """"Summary"""", which makes it sound more definitive than I perhaps meant). I'd write it differently now, with more references for a start. I've just rewritten the Summary to be less OR, although it still needs the references.
The rest is not incredibly straightforward as a lot of the most recent research is not in widely available reliable sources. I think Bane's stuff is fine as far as it goes, especially his summary of other people's research, but it's not a published book. Strickland and Hardy is probably the most authoritative, but it is a little out of date. Having said that, they came to fairly similar conclusions to later writers, if you ignore the outlying Primitive Archer test. Rogers' stuff looking at armour thickness on the limbs is also interesting, but again, it's in an appendix of another work.

I believe that stating that the two groups have no """"direct"""" affiliation would be clearer.

Also, the source cited regarding Pakistani support for the Afghan Taliban only alludes to incidents prior to the US invasion of Afghanistan.  However, Reference #6 (from 2009) does indicate more current coordination between elements within the ISI and the Afghan Taliban.  I am going to modify the statement slightly to reflect these two points.

110th CONGRESS 1st Session S. RES. 300

Expressing the sense of the Senate that the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) should stop the utilization of materials that violate provisions of the United Nations-brokered Interim Agreement between FYROM and Greece regarding `hostile activities or propaganda' and should work with the United Nations and Greece to achieve longstanding United States and United Nations policy goals of finding a mutually-acceptable official name for FYROM.

IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

August 3, 2007

RESOLUTION

Expressing the sense of the Senate that the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) should stop the utilization of materials that violate provisions of the United Nations-brokered Interim Agreement between FYROM and Greece regarding `hostile activities or propaganda' and should work with the United Nations and Greece to achieve longstanding United States and United Nations policy goals of finding a mutually-acceptable official name for FYROM.

Whereas, on April 8, 1993, the United Nations General Assembly admitted as a member the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), under the name the `Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia';

Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 817 (1993) states that the dispute over the name must be resolved to maintain peaceful relations between Greece and FYROM;

Whereas, on September 13, 1995, Greece and FYROM signed a United Nations-brokered Interim Accord that, among other things, commits them to not `support claims to any part of the territory of the other party or claims for a change of their existing frontiers';

Whereas a pre-eminent goal of the United Nations Interim Accord was to stop FYROM from utilizing, since its admittance to the United Nations in 1993, what the Accord calls `propaganda', including in school textbooks;

Whereas a television report in recent years showed students in a state-run school in FYROM still being taught that parts of Greece, including Greek Macedonia, are rightfully part of FYROM;

Whereas some textbooks, including the Military Academy textbook published in 2004 by the Military Academy `General Mihailo Apostolski' in the FYROM capital city, contain maps showing that a `Greater Macedonia' extends many miles south into Greece to Mount Olympus and miles east to Mount Pirin in Bulgaria;

Whereas, in direct contradiction of the spirit of the United Nations Interim Accord's section `A', entitled `Friendly Relations and Confidence Building Measures', which attempts to eliminate challenges regarding `historic and cultural patrimony', the Government of FYROM recently renamed the capital city's international airport `Alexander the Great Airport';

Whereas the aforementioned acts constitute a breach of FYROM's international obligations deriving from the spirit of the United Nations Interim Accord, which provide that FYROM should abstain from any form of `propaganda' against Greece's historical or cultural heritage;

Whereas such acts are not compatible with Article 10 of the United Nations Interim Accord, which calls for `improving understanding and good neighbourly relations', as well as with European standards and values endorsed by European Union member-states; and

Whereas this information, like that exposed in the media report and elsewhere, being used contrary to the United Nations Interim Accord instills hostility and a rationale for irredentism in portions of the population of FYROM toward Greece and the history of Greece: Now, therefore, be it

Resolved, That the Senate

(1) urges the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) to observe its obligations under Article 7 of the 1995 United Nations-brokered Interim Accord, which directs the parties to `promptly take effective measures to prohibit hostile activities or propaganda by state-controlled agencies and to discourage acts by private entities likely to incite violence, hatred or hostility' and review the contents of textbooks, maps, and teaching aids to ensure that such tools are stating accurate information; and

(2) urges FYROM to work with Greece within the framework of the United Nations process to achieve longstanding United States and United Nations policy goals by reaching a mutually-acceptable official name for FYROM.",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

When a numbered IP starts screwing with your article, you revert him. End of story. Everyone will back you up on that. Esecially since you're never supposed to delete sourcing from an article. Because people who do that put the article author in the situation you're in now.
I'm just annoyed because Rant Media does quite obviously deserve an article by WP's guidelines. However, because the people who've made Rant articles and SK articles on Wikipedia over the past 5 years have often done such a bad job, writing articles that read like spam, not following Wikipedia's standard format, we've now ended up in a situation where the AfD can result in a salt - that's where they """"salt the earth"""" so the article can never again be created.
And meanwhile, once this artilce is deleted, Sean Kennedy'll be spending another 6 months being all whiney and snitty about Wikipedia again. I won't be able to listen to him. 
Ultimately, to reach your goal, it doesn't matter what's right and wrong here. What matters is that the various Wikipedia editors in AfD see that you've followed the rules: that your article is as good as any others and that it's as well-sourced as any others. If you've been watching and listening to Sean Kennedy you already know that. Infiltration requires not being seen to be the enemy. 
Go look at Order of Nine Angles. That's an article I rescued from AfD. The article used to, ages ago, be quite frankly stupid. It's about a supposed Satanic cult, of which there's only 1 confirmed member. But since it was mentioned in half a dozen scholarly books or more, I managed to get the article accepted - by following the rules. It's the only real article I've ever worked on, and I had to learn all the footnoting and formatting from scratch. If I can make that article acceptable, you can easily make a RantMedia article acceptable. The problem is you're almost out of time - you can completely repair an article during AfD, and that will give you a chance to avoid a delete vote. But you'd have to start now.

Wikipedia's founder, Jimmy Wales, has admitted that the much loved """"free encyclopedia"""" has at least some quality problems. To some of us, this is nothing new. I've had more than one student rely on Wikipedia for accurate information for a paper, and it always ends up the same way: """"well, I got it off of Wikipedia, thinking it was good..."""".

And therein lies the problem. If you keep in mind that anyone, and I mean anyone, can edit a Wikipedia entry, then you are treading on dangerous ground if you're going to cite it as a source of fact. While it's true that errors often get corrected, they don't always, and what happens in the meantime is that bad info sits there, misinforming people. Of course, this isn't true just in the case of Wikipedia. It's a problem online, in general. I recently was party to an argument over the historicity of Jesus, and one person used a source that claimed that Philo of Alexandria lived in Jerusalem. He's called Philo of Alexandria for a reason, you know.[] 

I used to be such an unadulterated fan of Wikipedia you know. The idea of an open source online reference that grew on a daily basis was quite an attractive one back in the day. But in recent times I've become wary of the encyclopaedia anyone can edit, and not simply because of a few high profile choice edits.

Whatever about libel and congressional cherry picking amidst the many articles of this once noble enterprise, what really gets me about Wikipedia is that I can't trust it on most issues. There are so many agendas, axes to grind and purely mischievous vandals that 90% of what I would be interested in reading about - history, politics and so on - is tripe. To read an article on a contentious subject one can pick out bias, attempted compromise and ultimate failure almost immediately. Wade into the """"Talk"""" page, where these edits are discussed, and you are confronted with chaos. There are too many vested interests at stake, and from the War on Terror to the Welfare State one will find an army of people taking one view or another entering into what are known as """"Revert Wars"""", where they revert any edits back to the version which suits them.

From self-interest to political interest one can find """"POV"""" (Point of View) shading almost every major article that touches on the live wires of our society. Thus I wouldn't trust anything that's even half-way current or ongoing on Wikipedia.

For one, the facts can be skewed. Secondly, the article can change overnight depending on how organised a campaign is launched against an article (and they do happen.)

 Quebec registration plates prohibited in front?

 November 2015 

 Hello, Callmemirela! It is nice to meet you. Your help in improving the page for Criminal Minds (season 11), specifically the episode section, is much appreciated!I'm glad you kept me on my toes about putting the episode summary in my own words, so as not to violate any copyright laws; for that I'm quite grateful to you. Criminal Minds is, by far, my favorite show and I love to help keep fellow fans informed.

However, in my entire time editing Criminal Minds pages - which has been a little while; while I am fairly new to Wikipedia, this account was created with the (2) at the end because my previous account of the same name was inaccessible because I forgot my password lol - I have not once, by any editor, been asked/required to provide refernces for the production codes. Title, writer, director, and air date absolutely require references! But the production code is usually confirmed in one of the references whether it be title, writer, director, air date or any combination therein, added to the fact that the air dates can help determine the order in which the episodes will air, they are almost always confirmed.

Although, I have come to understand there can be an exception in which the production codes can serve quite useful! This is when episodes air out of order, an example of which would be in Season 10, 1006, """"Boxed In"""", was aired before 1005, """"If the Shoe Fits"""", because """"Boxed In"""" was the Halloween episode and it was scheduled to air on 11/05 whereas """"If the Shoe Fits"""" was scheduled to air on 10/29; to resolve this, they merely switched their air dates, however, the production codes remained the same, therefore letting people know that they were aired out of order to accommodate Halloween. In that case, I believe it was briefly required to include references with the production codes. That, however, was the only time I've ever been required to provide a reference for a production code.

I've posted references for all of the upcoming production codes to satisfy your need for me to do so and prove to you that I would not post those codes without knowing that their validity can eventually be found through other references. In conclusion, I absolutely agree with you that I needed to avoid violating copyright by denoting the summaries in a vernacular (lexicon; vocabulary; my own words) more unique to me, basically, to make them be more so in my own words, but I don't agree that the production codes need referencing. You are the first person who has ever asked me to do so. I do want you to know, though, that I always use reliable references for my episode title, writer, director and/or air date contributions, and that I take copyright violation (avoiding it!) very seriously!

I really appreciate your willingness to help make the page as accurate as possible; that is my objective as well. I just don't think that it is necessary to reference the production codes, since all episodes have aired in order, thus far, and we (the fans) have been given no reason to believe they won't continue to do so. When it is required due to scheduling changes, I'd be happy to post it. I hope we can resolve this minor misunderstanding. Happy editing!

Hi, I can see that you know more than a little bit about deletions so I want to get your opinion on something. The article Tony Grove is a single sentence which (I think) fails to assert notability per WP:BIO, and it seems doubtful the article could reasonably be expanded. Do you think this is an appropriate candidate for AfD? If so, should it get a """"Prod"""" or just get nom'd for AfD? Thanks in advance for taking the time to educate this newcomer! PS - I noticed you are currently located in Milwaukee, WI. You have my heartfelt condolences ) Also, you can respond here when convenient; I've got you on my watchlist.   
Hey, I like Milwaukee! 
First I'd do some quick google research on the guy, and if nothing came up, then give it a prod tag. If someone de-prods it and you still think he's NN, then go with AfD. Cheers!  talk 

Thanks Fang! I'll follow your advice. I just had to tease you a little because I spent many years in WI, and I hate snow ) Milwaukee can be fun though, especially The Safe House!

If it feels like home to you, then it must be...Home. I had already done the Google search as the first step; out of the first 50 hits I previewed only one mentioned the guy, and that was our article ) It seems like it's time for a prod. Very exciting, I've never done this before so, um...er...what do I do? 

In the article, add {{prod|Why you think it should be deleted}} at the top.  talk 

I got the Prod in place per your directions. Thanks for taking so much time to help a newcomer )

What do the three edits Feb. 24 have to do with the sock puppetry investigation of COI from 2006 and early 2007?

The article is edited and watched closely now. 

Are the only recent edits those three attempted additions to the Barack Obama article? Hardly a high crime it seems to me.

b9022813bdf238d5,"""== Discussing recombination ==

Recently I noticed that this article uses 'genetic recombination' to refer to recombination that occurs during in meiosis and brings about genetic diversity among organisms.  This isn't necessarily correct: genetic recombination can also refer to non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or V(D)J recombination, neither of which, to my knowledge, occur during meiosis or produce heritable genetic diversity among organisms.  To account for that, I think it would be helpful to replace instances of 'genetic recombination' with 'homologous recombination', the type of genetic recombination to which this article refers.  What are others' thoughts on this?  The only drawback I could see would be the slightly less reader-friendly word 'homologous'. This, however, seems clarified by the first sentence in the 'Sex and recombination' section to invoke the phrase: """"In the related process of genetic recombination, sexual organisms can also exchange DNA between two matching chromosomes.""""  If the inaccessibility of the word 'homologous' were in fact a drawback, I think it would be more than compensated for by the greater accuracy of the information being presented to the reader.

Yesterday I tried introducing this change, but was reverted.  In the summary of that reversion, the editor noted: """"why be less general? homologous excludes translocations, duplications, fusions, etc.""""  I've offered my rationale for being specific just above, but was curious about the second sentence.  If homologous recombination excludes translocations, duplications, fusions, etc., then is that somehow accounted for by other types of genetic recombination, like NHEJ or V(D)J recombanation?  To my understanding, it is a failure of homologous recombination in meiosis that produces heritable chromosome translocations, fusions, and gene duplications.    

I think you are correct, being more accurate is better since the sentence does refer specifically to matching chromosomes. I've reworded this to state In a related process called homologous recombination, sexual organisms exchange DNA between two matching chromosomes. I've added the idea of general recombination to the previous section, adding Mutations can involve large sections of DNA becoming duplicated, usually through genetic recombination.   

 Charles Darwin film 'too controversial for religious America' 

""""A British film about Charles Darwin has failed to find a US distributor because his theory of evolution is too controversial for American audiences, according to its producer.""""    

That's a laugh. Please don't try to make evolution look like it's a helpless victim being attacked by a bunch of religious nuts. The theory of evolution does have many loopholes, but America is not religious by any means; I'm shocked that an American producer turned down the film. —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs) 

Sorry, I just don't see how evolution can be a controversial topic - evolution is all around us, simple as that. People who tend to object to such basic fundamental facts of life tends not to understand the depth of the topic to the point of understanding it, but rather the shallow aspect to justify their lack of understanding. Not everyone is good at science so some people would tend to take the shallow route of critizing something if they don't understand. Example; I'm terrible at pre-calculus so I critize the aspect of pre-calculus to justify my understanding - see where I'm getting at?

Not relevant here. The Evolution article is not about Charles Darwin, the film is not about evolution, and there is an entirely separate page for the creation–evolution controversy. Please don't post sociological trivia on the Talk page of a biology article. (Also, evolutionary theory does not have """"loopholes."""") -  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

However, recent articles have, for the most part, dropped specific refrences to any individual other than Ben Collins in this role.  Seeing as one of the main reasons for the Stig being mentioned in secondary sources (like the press) is due to his identity, this is some of the most important information about the role and ought to be in the lead section.  Since Ben Collins has repeatedly been linked to the role in the press (unlike anybody else), this should be clearly mentioned.  Since the speculation that the Stig is Ben Collins is highly relevant and verifiable, comment should be made of this speculation in the lead.",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Well Maybe theres a reason it was taken off. I think its because her voice isnt as good as it used to be. but still I say her range is Bb2-G#7 but all that can be proven is a range of C3-G#7. C3 is the lowest note in My All, Emotions, You're So Cold, and I believe other songs. A1 is my lowest note and F7 is my highest and Im a Lyric Baritone. I don't know if Mariah has ever sang above the piano or in the second octave because there is no audio to prove it. All I know is alot of people exaggerate her voice alot. Notes should be checked before saying what they are. People start rumors about alot of things like the note in You're So Cold being G2. Its not. My way of checking notes is by using a keyboard. its pretty accurate too. Its better than a tuner. Tuners can be thrown off by the slightest extra sound. the best way to check a note using a tuner is to copy the note by singing it yourself. But keyboards are easy cause it wont produce a note an octave lower or anything as most people tend to do if they feel a note is too high or an octave higher if the note is too low. You should always check a note yourself and ask another person if you can rely on them.  06:27",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

 Outline of knowledge WikiProject update - 04/02/2009 

Hi everyone.

Things are going slow again.  Where have you been?!

Maybe what you need to get you going is a little competition...

 Who are we competing with? 

Encyclopedia Britannica.  Specifically, with its Outline of knowledge (presented in its volume called the Propaedia).  Currently, they're kicking our asses.  You've really got to check out their Outline of Knowledge (available only in the encyclopedia's paper edition - not the online version).

Portals. Informally, of course, just for the fun of it.  There are around 600 portals.  We're about 100 behind them, with about 500 outlines.  Let's blow past them and leave 'em in the dust!

 Confusion in editors at large 

Now that the country outlines have been moved to the encyclopedia proper (article space), recruiting help on these is of high priority  it will soon be time to alert all relevant editors to the nature and function of these and how they relate to other country coverage on Wikipedia.

However, I've noticed instances in which editors do not understand the nature and function of outline pages, and complain that they are redundant to articles.  Well, ya.  (That's the point of an outline - to provide the essentials in a structure for greater understanding, for easy viewing and faster reading, and to provide a topical guide).  

A few editors over the years have viewed outlines as redundant to portals, not understanding the purpose and scope of outlines, nor the benefits provided by their structure and standardization.

These problems of misunderstanding need to be solved before """"going public"""", to prevent their expansion as the community's awareness of these pages increases.  Consider the response we'd get now if we announced these pages on the talk pages of 500 WikiProjects, 500 article talk pages, and placed links in 500 see also sections, etc.

That could be a nightmare.

So...

 Encyclopedic and administrative support 

I've been working on a couple things that will help alleviate confusion and hopefully reduce the need for editors to ask questions and seek advice.   They're drafts, still under construction.  Please look these over and jump in and help complete them (directly or by providing feedback):

First is an  article draft, intended to replace the current Outline article.

Next is a  on the Outline of knowledge and its outline pages.

Let me know what you think.  Do they help you understand outlines better and how to develop them on Wikipedia?  What is missing?  How can they be improved?

Thanks Nadiatalent, your comments are helpful and I've made another try at the Social issues text below, adding in new references for the first paragraph and placing the reference for Indonesia at the end of the second paragraph (an oversight on my part before). In this second try I have also made some changes to the wording of the first paragraph so that it is accurate to the references.

The new references for the first paragraph are studies on Malaysia and Indonesia. I'll provide quotes here so that you can see what they say about palm oil production's social impact:

1. Socio-Economic Impact Assessment of Palm Oil Production: 
""""The data showed generally positive financial and socio-economic consequences of oil palm adoption in the immediate surroundings of oil palm estates.""""
""""In terms of industry and economic opportunities, OPCs [oil palm communities] feature more wood-based industries, and a higher numbers of shops, minimarkets and hotels.""""

2, The local impacts of oil palm expansion in Malaysia: 
""""According to respondents, the primary reasons for shifting from traditional livelihood activities to oil palm cultivation were higher returns for oil palm due to perceived high prices (43.3%) and perceived ease of managing oil palm plantations (30%).""""
""""Generally, oil palm has brought positive impacts, such as increased income, secure employment, and improved access to social services. However, involvement in oil palm has also caused many local communities to move away from traditional practices.""""
See also the table of results on page 11 which lists """"Increased income"""", """"More steady or reliable income"""", """"Education"""", """"Better access to transport services"""", """"Health facilities"""", """"Accommodation"""" as survey respondents' perceived benefits of palm oil production.

For the point about landholders being able to participate in the cash economy, I think the existing reference works. Here is the quote:

""""...the authority has set up a number of joint ventures with NCR [native customary rights] landholders. Under these agreements, local title-holders are paid a dividend, ensuring that part of the profits flow back into the community.""""

Oil palm is a valuable economic crop and provides a source of employment. It allows small landholders to participate in the cash economy and often results in improvements to local infrastructure and greater access to services such as schools and health facilities. In some areas, the cultivation of oil palm has replaced traditional practices, often due to the higher income potential of palm oil.

However, in some cases, land has been developed by oil palm plantations without consultation or compensation of the indigenous people occupying the land. This has occurred in Papua New Guinea, Colombia, and Indonesia. In the Sarawak state of Malaysian Borneo, there has been debate over whether there was an appropriate level of consultation with the Long Teran Kanan community prior to the develo",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Still, it seems reasonable to label beating-related deaths like that. A person having beaten and dying soon afterwards reasonably dies related to that. Analogically, a massive cyberbullying case that makes objectively mesurable neurotic symptoms is reasonably related to a death if the death occurs soon or in that context. Of course, the person may have emotional labilities from earlier, but, following the beating and heart attack analogy, I think the """"no direct casue-and-effect"""" argument goes to far.

Plagiarism is not copyright infringement. While both terms may apply to a particular act, they are different transgressions. Copyright infringement is a violation of the rights of a copyright holder, when material protected by copyright is used without consent. On the other hand, plagiarism is concerned with the unearned increment to the plagiarizing author's reputation that is achieved through false claims of authorship.

 Perpetual Virginity 

The article currently states: """"After giving birth to Christ, Mary did have sexual relations,"""" and """"In the little time that Joseph was still around after the birth of and they had several more children.""""  Certainly some people believe these assertions, but they don't belong in an article that presents the Roman Catholic Church's Marian dogmas.

The article also says that: """"Mary did break her vow by the grace of God.""""  The writer seems to mean that God gave Mary a free pass to have sex but remain a virgin.  That really needs a citation, because I've never heard anything like it.  The RC Church teaches that Mary was really and truly a virgin her whole life, and other people believe she had sex and bore children, but as far as I know, no one teaches that she had sex, but God was okay with it, so we call her a virgin anyway.  Without a citation, this statement should go.

 The data mass is fragmented in spontaneous posts from different writers in near-random order with at present only a crude indexing by desk subject

 Their occurrences in 3- and 4- character known combinations lend themselves to fast automated search

 A hypothesis by several respected editors is that we are seeing an evolutionary change in English usage of ITS and IT'S. I think we have a golden opportunity to apply Scientific method here. There is a prediction that can be verified quantatively.

 What proportion of educated speakers combat the orthodox spelling?

The article was vandalized a few days ago and is now being returned to its original state. Any users wishing to dispute the information should do so here. If sysops examine the network log files, they will discover that the vast majority of referers come from 9/11 Truth sites, and the vast majority of exit links go to 9/11 Truth sites. Therefore, removing that information was damaging wikipedia's reputation. Visitors are depending on wikipedia to cover the work that Jones is currently involved in, which of course includes everything relating to 9/11 that was on that page.

Using the CT term to describe 9/11 theories is ad hominem and also not NPOV, and therefore not civil. Anyone endorsing that type of thinking is not NPOV and ask them to not edit the 9/11 pages.

I really don't care all that much about the Jewish lists and categories.  I've voted on some of them, mostly because other editors have solicited my input (I think with more confidence in what I would opine than is merited).  My votes on those have been mixed, and have depended on how specific the topics are, and whether I think they can be done in an encyclopedic fashion.  But I'm neither one of those people who votes """"keep"""" for anything with the word """"Jewish"""" in it; nor am I an editor who votes """"delete"""" whenever I see the word (we have some of each, and I think both are acting with a bit of bad faith).

I am, however, very offended by abuse of the administrative systems of WP in violation of WP:POINT.  I guess you're a newbie, and are perhaps not entirely aware of procedures.  We all start out that way.  In actual fact, there is a """"criteria for speedy deletion"""" that allows removal of pages that have been previously deleted by AfD.  There are a lot of rules floating around, and they are not all consistent with each other, so you can certainly be forgiven for not knowing all, or even most, of them.

But an AfD is for a very specific thing, and something very different from your spurious nomination.  FWIW, Arniep also violated WP:POINT by massively nominating """"Jewish Foo"""" lists that he actually wanted kept.  And he got blocked for 48 hours (rightly) as a warning.  What an AfD is for is to get a page that you genuinely think fails to cover an encyclopedic topic removed from Wikipedia.  It is not a way to express displeasure with particular editors of that page.  It is not a way to push the idea that the page would be better if modified in some fashion.  And it is not a way to get even with editors who voted """"delete"""" on some other page that you believe is conceptually equivalent to the page you nominate.

There are lots of pages that I think should be better, and where I think the editors are putting in material that is not encyclopedic, and where the structure of the article is not optimal (maybe it needs refactoring into subpages).  As a good WP citizen who follows Wikiquette, I raise those issues on the article talk pages.  I attempt edits to the page directly.  Perhaps I create a temporary version of the page that more closely fits what I think it should be like.  What I do not do is nominate pages that I think cover worthwhile topics for AfD as a way of bullying the editors whose edits I do not like.

If you follow Wikiquette, you'll get along with people here, and be a productive editor.  If you violate it, you'll make lots of enemies, increase general animosity, and fail to get anything done.  Your start so far has not been portentious; but you certainly have time left to learn, and to make amends.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Langston Hughes
Hi Bobcat, I saw that you have submitted Langston Hughes for GA review. Having been involved in some of the GA process I have to say, I don't think LH is ready for this, for various reasons. There is not one major editor looking after or improving the page and hasn't been for many years. This means there's nobody involved who's ready and set to do all the work to bring it up to GA standard. Much of it has no citation, which is a must for a GA. There is no section about the themes and/or style of his work, critical appraisal and such, which is also needed. I appreciate it's a vote of confidence in the article, which is great, but I know that there is a long GA appraisal backlog and it's a pretty time consuming process for reviewers. (There's work waiting since January to be reviewed). Maybe have a look at poet's articles such as W. B. Yeats, Maya Angelou and Walt Whitman to get a sense of what's needed. Editors often submit articles for a peer review first, to get a general sense of where the article is at and what works needs doing, before applying for the whole GA/FA hog. So, I'd personally recommend withdrawing the application for GA and maybe work on some of the article points until the basics are in place. Thanks and best wishes   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Dear “Lessheard vanU” and to Wikipedia including all editors and administrators & Mr. Wales:   This is a very serious issue.  We contributing writers have attempted to follow wikipedia written polices in contributing and adding to an existing article or creating one.  Yet there are double standards beings upheld by wikipedia’s own editors and administrators.  As with Blackpearl14, who clearly believes that wikipedias polices don’t apply to her, and with other editors who uphold double standards.   Then when challenged to the double standards, including Blackpearl14's violation of wikipedia’s own written polices and reckless authoritarian rule and control, other wikipedia editors and administrators then support each other when one of them continues to violate wikipedia’s own written polices.    “Lessheard vanU” had then wrongly and deliberately calls the contributing people who writes back and flags the issue at hand a “harassing the editor”, outright agreeing with Blackpearl14.  Then in addition to IP address being blocked, all “talk & discussion” are deleted  leaving only one sided bias and reckless claims against the contributing writers.  Even though wrongly deleted by wikipedia editors & administrators, all of this has been recorded, including that Blackpearl14 having repeatedly writing in both correspondence and her bio page (copies have been secure)  that the articles belong to her and they will continue to be own and controlled by her.  These statements alone proves that she is in violation of wikipedia’s own written polices and purpose.  Yet you have ignored that.

As previously written in discussion, per wikipedia’s own written polices, but immediately deleted by Blackpearl14 and then sanctioned by  “Lessheard vanU”, Blackpearll4 - calls herself evidently Mrs. Johnny Depp and Pirate lord-ess and such.  She celebrates on her official wikipedia bio pages that she did many pages and articles on the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean for wikipedia.   Why would someone devote so much time to 24/7 check the site and on these pages, and then recklessly calls anyone who doesn’t follow her bias views vandals, attackers and such.   Has her judgement become impaired?   Her goal to fuse her love and fantasies with the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean is very clear.  That is a conflict of interest and that is not being neutral and is against wikipedia’s own written polices.  Sorry, but if one purchases products, such as Pirates of the Caribbean posters, toys and Walt Disney merchandise and also using emotional love and fantasies for wikipedia / wikinews articles, doesn’t make the articles neutral and it causes a conflict of interest.   As recorded, Blackpearl14's pages regarding this issue are one sided, not neutral, are bias, in conflict of interest and are all promotional tools promoting the causes and products of the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean.   Yes, Pirates of the Caribbean and similar wikipedia articles are not neutral, they are a series of one sided promotional pages including links to products and causes of the Walt Disney Company.   Following wikipedia’s own written “neutral” policy, entire articles would have to be deleted.    Yet Blackpearl14 continues to violate Wikipedia polices and purpose.  

Then with IP’s being deliberately blocked and contributing writers having been wrongly accused and falsely called various things, if anyone then attempts to generate a new article related to Pirates of the Caribbean following wikipedia’s own written polices, editors and administrators gang up and generate false reason upon reason, to delete those articles and ban the IP user.   They use a countless list of double standards and twisted logic to justify their reckless acts.   It’s a total lock out by the editors and administrators, abusing their trust tools, acting like a private monarchy.   To date, Blackpearl14's has proven she has ultimate control, has repeatedly stated that is her purpose, and had even sought to have the articles locked.    Then you “Lessheard vanU” wrote that you don’t want to lock these articles, stating it goes against company policy, but yet you added that you are preparing to possibly lock the articles in some capacity and do other acts against those who have been falsely branded and wrongly labeled as “vandals” and “harassing the editors” etc...

Other editors and administrators who have proven their practice of bias and manipulative and outright double standards practices include “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” and “Chris Mann”.   We have documented that they say one thing, yet practice another.   We have documented that they enforce one set of wikipedia polices yet discard and ignore those same policies when it applies to themselves or their selective circle of peers.

The solution to this is very simple. Find a source which says this isn't genocide. If you can't, then the article can't say that it might not have been genocide. Do you think you're the only person who has ever wanted to write something that can't be supported by WP:RS? I can think of a hundred occassions when it has stopped me contributing something I consider blindingly obvious. But WP:RS is the only way to keep Wikipedia halfway honest.
To address your criticism of the article, I point out that governments, for obvious reasons, are reluctant to issue a direct order to commit genocide even if genocide is their aim. Even Hitler didn't issue a direct order to gas all of the Jews in Europe. That doesn't mean that the Holocaust wasn't genocide. They will also always claim that the genocide was quid pro quo, or an unavoidable part of a war they are committing. The Kosovo war is an excellent example of this.
But many people today seem to think genocide, brutal warfare, terror actions and large massacres are the same thing and can all be called """"genocide"""" when you like. No way. During the Rwanda war, Madeleine Albright famously said that genocide wasn't being committed, but that acts of genocide were. How many massacres make a genocide? You seem to think it is obvious that this episode of massacres did not add up to genocide. But the point at which many massacres become genocide is, tragically, subjective.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

 Role in Russian civil war 

That section states the Bolsheviks won that war in the late 1919. That is completely wrong by any historic books and textbooks. Officially the war ended in 1922, but there was still fighting going on in the Russian Far East. That is what the Soviet historical textbooks say. For some reason the war with the Ukraine is being perceived as the Civil war in Soviet times and it seems that the same trend exist today as well. That is also wrong. Ukraine was a recognized state by the Soviet Russia as well as by the other numerous countries. That was a straight aggresion against the Ukrainian republic, following an unbelievable slaughtering of population in Ukraine by bolsheviks (Kyiv and Podillia still remembered). In 1920 Ukraine united with Poland to stop the bolshevik bandits. The Soviet textbooks state that it was an intervention of the """"White"""" Polish burgouis, relating it to the Russian white movement which is way off. 

Not on the subject of the section, but Stalin should be recognized as the enemy of the world and, at least, should be on the same page with Adolf Hitler. Stalin was way more evil. Not all of his wrongdoings are uncovered, but the one that already are known can easily convict the guy. His name should be cursed for the eternity and humanity needs to learn to avoid the next Stalin.   

Define """"convict."""" What exactly is Stalin guilty of? Killing off men and women that he believed threatened the unity and safety of his nation? Knights did that all the time. Under Stalin, the Soviet Union became incredibly well-developed, albeit uncaring towards others. They even beat us in the space race. I'm sure all of our wonderful presidents would have thought that would happen with the amazing ideals of wonderful democracy. Luna RainHowLCry

 The official language box can only have Malay because Malay is the only official language.

 About what """"quick-failing"""" reeally is for 

efore conducting an extensive review, and after ensuring you are viewing an unvandalized version, check the article and its edit history for the following basic problems which are sometimes found in GA nominations.

 The article completely lacks reliable sources – see Wikipedia:Verifiability.Small articles that have a single main source may still be adequately referenced without the use of inline citations.  Inline citations may not be required for some articles; the criteria name the only six types of material that require inline citations.
 The topic is treated in an obviously non-neutral way – see Wikipedia:Neutral point of view.Articles on controversial topics can be both neutral and stable, but this is only ensured if regular editors make scrupulous efforts to keep the article well-referenced.  Note that neutrality does not mean that all points of view are covered equally: instead no point of view should be given undue weight.
 There are cleanup banners that are obviously still valid, including , ,  or large numbers of , , or similar inline tags. (See also .)
 The article is or has been the subject of ongoing or recent, unresolved edit wars.
 The article specifically concerns a rapidly unfolding current event with a definite endpoint.
 The article contains significant close paraphrasing or copyright violations

Another thing to look for is that if the article has been nominated more than once, go back to the previous reviews and make sure suggestions from the other reviews have been addressed.

If the article has any of the above problems, it may be premature to provide a detailed review, in which case you can """"quickfail"""" the nomination in accordance with step two of the GAN guidelines, as long as you explain this clearly on the review page. They most commonly apply when the nominator is inexperienced or is not a regular editor of the article. If you """"quick-fail"""" an article according to the above criteria, leave a short note explaining the major problems and inform the nominator.

Even if an article can be """"quick-failed"""" according to the above criteria, reviewers could also: 

 Leave a short note explaining the major problems, but without officially closing the review until the editors at the article have had a few days to respond to your concerns.  You may find that they are interested in significantly improving the article.
 Provide a detailed review, as more specific information will help future editors improve the article to meet all of the Good article criteria, but close the review as """"not listed"""".
 Withdraw from the review, and let another reviewer decide how to handle it.

Emphasis added by me. So please remember to always actually/carefully read any policies/guidelines before using them (and to not ask other users for opinions, because they might be completely misguided - just always find and read them yourself), like that (source).   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

The Chance family has been involved with the Tarsus Club for several generations, dating back to the 1600s when the family was intrinsic to the formation of the British East India Company. After receiving a Doctorate of Law from Harvard, Murray Chance served as the U.S. assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, a position in which he won two Distinguished Service medals. In 1969 he took over for his father as the Chairman of Chance Investments where he continues to serve on the board of directors. He has worked as an advisor to three sitting US presidents, and sits on the board of The Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg Group and the Council on Foreign Relations. He is the current co-chairman of the EU-Japan Business Dialogue Round Table and chairman of the European Academy of Business in Society. He is also a member of the board of numerous North American and European companies. In 2009, the newspaper EUobserver credited Chance as """"one of the leading forces that helped create the euro in the 1990s"""".""",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

The example is a poor one, and should be removed from the article. The article states that it seems to require 5 colors, presumably because the grey area cannot simply be colored red, yellow or blue without re-coloring. However, it *can* be colored green, and that doesn't require shuffling any of the other colors around. This makes it a very misleading counterexample. I know I spent a lot of time scratching my head wondering why this was considered a counter-example at all, and how the caption made any sense. Please either replace it with an example which does need to be re-colored in order to work or remove it (not that I don't think it's a valiant attempt, but it's just confusing).

 It's not worth worrying too much more about this for this year, as these tables will soon be finalised, but there will need to be a better solution for future campaigns. The colour used above whilst distinct seems out of place with the rest of the pallette. Granted that is an aesthetic concern only, and I appreciate this change was motivated by concern for the accessibility of the table, but really, if we are concerned about accessibility then using colour alone to convey meaning is a really bad move. In future I would recommend an additional column to the table with the actual qualification status in text. Even single character abbreviations would work such as Q, P, 2, R and E.

Oh, and if you haven't been able to chase up a reason for Bravada's untimely departure, I think - based on his final contribs - that it was due to some issues over his views VS those of others about Polish politics, which seem at the moment to be very nearly a blood sport.

Hi Math. Thanks for the page with the pictures of her art. I find it very interesting. Her pictures of women's bodies as commodities are very disturbing, while her photos of Morrissey are beautiful. I really want to get my hands on the Morrissey Shot book, but I couldn't order it from amazon, apparently they can't ship it to my country.

Anyway, I know what you're talking about, information on Linder and Ludus is very hard to find. Besides the Ludus biography you quoted, I've come across a couple of articles about an exhibition she did in 2000: The Guardian article http://film.guardian.co.uk/Feature_Story/feature_story/0,,138286,00.html
and here is a long and in-depth article:
http://www.3ammagazine.com/litarchives/nov2001/manchester_voodoo.html

Her real name is Linda Mulvey. The Guardian article gives info on her date and place of birth (1954, Liverpool) and a bit on her background.

I have some pictures from Ludus sleeves that I might include in the article.

Besides The Importance of Being Morrissey, Linder also appeared in Southbank Show on The Smiths. 

What other magazine articles have you found about her? She's usually mentioned in connection with Morrissey, and even that is very rarely. The only magazine article I can think of is that (in)famous Nick Kent """"The Face"""" 1985 article on The Smiths. There are also a few pages about her in """"The Severed Alliance"""", but it's similar stuff as in that Ludus biography you posted the link to, plus some interesting quotes by Richard Boon and Trotter. Apparently her flat in Whalley Range was sort of a bohemian haven for many musicins and artists. They also claim she had quite an influence over men in her circle, that Pete Shelley wrote Buzzcocks' 'What Do I Get' as a plea of unrequited love for her, and that she inspired a lot of Devoto's early work. Her name also pops up a lot in """"Songs That Saved Your Life"""" - besides Cemetry Gates, she's mentioned in entries for Miserable Lie, Wonderful Woman, Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me (in connection to a weird matrix message that was initially supposed to be on the single) and I Won't Share You. In the latter, there's another quote from the unused Morrissey sleeve note for the cancelled Crepuscule Ludus restrospective - the end of the note sounds very familiar: """"Oh Linder. Oh Linder. I'll see you sometime, somewhere."""" 

However, I'm not sure if you should mention any of this stuff in an article, for one thing it comes close to or falls directly into the realm of speculation on personal matters... then again, it's not like Wikipedia articles do not include speculation and rumours (Morrissey page is one of the examples!) But it would be wrong to make it seem as if she is more important for her relationships with male musicians than for her own work... so I don't know.

 I interpret it as that as we have sources that are conflicting on basic information. While each of the sources appears reliable enough none of them can be reliably, and verifiability, traced back to either reports written by the people involved with the operation or someone that interviewed them. There does seem to be wide agreement that OBL was hit twice with the first shot being somewhere in the chest/trunk (depending on the report), and the second in the head. There are conflicting reports on the number of shooters and the number of shots fired.

 We have a couple of options for the article. 1) Only report those items that seem to have wide agreement and to be silent on those details where our sources offer conflicting data. 2) Document the conflicting details along with the sources. I'd personally go with #1 as it'll be a cleaner article. We'd have a constant battle with people trying to inject a POV such as """"OBL was shot twice by one person - look at all these sources.""""

 I have a personal concern with the New Yorker version of the events in that it mentions the assault team blowing their way through doors and walls. For the first couple of days after the mission it appeared the public was allowed to wander around the compound and were only restricted from the innermost courtyard. Lots of people took photos. I never saw a photo of a hole blown into a wall nor did I see any apparent damage to the doors. Visible evidence of the assault would have been of great interest and no one took a photo? Thus, I'd say the New Yorker and other articles article is wrong on that detail. The assault team likely found the inner doors were unlocked and/or scaled the walls to get into the compound and to move between the walled off sections of the compound.

 There are other concerns about the New Yorker article in that it switches from great detail which appears to build credibility and the impression that this is an """"inside account"""" to an absence of information on basic things such as what team #1 was doing immediately after they landed. I suspect the entire thing was spun together out of speculative opinions by others. Unfortunately, many of the articles about this incident have similar issues. |talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

As such the world view of this article is correct since the article itself correctly describes the history on the world view.

Cube, its not a threat. I just have to do some things differently now obviously because I wasnt expecting this block at all. I have to change the way I see Wikipedia or maybe I'll just leave, I dont know. I have to take some decisions, is what I meant.
Xeno, if I have violated WP:POINT, is that a bigger offense than being rude and offensive? I dont understand how someone can be blocked for making a point, but not for saying things like """"what are you fucking on about"""" and all the other kinds of comments I gathered here. Isnt something wrong here? What is wrong is, I'll just say it: Jimbo's tolerance for rude and aggresive behavior. That may change if I get a reply from him but the fact that comments like the ones I gathered above, are being allowed to be said, without any punishment or enforcement of discipline and that, people are ok with, is a serious problem here. My """"violating"""" comment was to show that rude offensive comments are wrong and should be enforced. Thats exactly what I have proved. Did I violate WP:POINT? Actually I explicitly mentioned in my post that I was indeed trying to """"deliver a point"""" (to quote myself). The point was to show Bali that he did not like what I said because the way I said it. The problem is that such behavior is not being enforced. It is OK if I was blocked for my comment, if that was the only thing I said. The admin did the right thing. However what should have happened is that Bali should have been blocked (say even 12 hours is fine, a week would be excessive) in the first place and that did not happen. What is sad that we all couldnt even agree that rude and offensive behavior is punishable. Even George came and complained about Bali's rudeness but nothing was done and the issue was closed. As far as the enforcement of being respectful to other editors is concerned, I think its a sad state of affairs. I will be talking about the problem of rudeness at Wikipedia with more people here and outside Wikipedia.

Taelus, the reason for the unblock is simple: I (obviously) did not mean what I said. I only said it to demonstrate that no one likes to be talked to in a rude, aggressive manner like Bali did (""""what are you fucking on about""""). Basically its absurd that I've been blocked for making a """"demo"""" post of rudeness while other editors go unpunished in real situations. In summary, my unblock reason is: """"I was kidding and trying to show an example.""""

You should not make any kind of link between them on-wiki, but equally it would be imperative that you privately communicate the link to AC and assure them that you intend to respect the restrictions applicable to your current name while they are in force.  Assure AC that you reject the imputations of proxy-editing in the past and give them your assurance that you will be sure not to do anything of the kind in the future.

I know this is quite difficult to accept for you muslims, but, as it is, this guy was (one of several) Muhammad's teacher. This is an irrefutable fact of history. I realise that the idea of Muhammad having a teacher beside Allah is some kind of heresy for you, but, here's the truth: Muhammad had an Assyrian Christian teacher. Muhammad learned a lot from him. I am not misrepresenting any source by pointing out this well known fact amongst theologians. It may be so, that Sargis Bkheera did not teach Muhammad about everything, but Muhammad gleaned a lot from him.

Here's what AINA says:

633 A.D. (5383)
Muhammad declares himself the prophet of God and originates Islam. It is well known that Muhammad's principal teacher was the Assyrian monk Sargis Bkheera. This accounts for the extraordinary doctrinal similarity between some aspects of Islam and the Assyrian Church of the East. For example, according to Assyrian Church doctrine, there is no awareness of passage of time between the moment of death and final judgement; final judgement occurs immediately even though thousands of years may have passed on Earth. Islam holds this same view. It is also noteworthy that the Koran states that in the day of final judgement the angels of Allah will speak to man in Assyrian.http://www.aina.org/aol/peter/timeline.htm''

Where do you think Muhammad got that from? Of course, he got it from his Assyrian Christian teacher. You want this referenced from some academic work? I'm sure that's no problem. Here you go, take your pick:  He was Muhammad's teacher. Stop reverting unless you have some source refuting this claim.

HurricaneWarning Template

Greeting, My Friend,

Both """"camps"""" in this discussion have compelling arguments, and I'm not sure on which side of the dispute I'd settle if I decided to comment.  You are correct that the template in question is contra ASF, and is not something anyone would wish to see universalized by extrapolation: every WP article could merit some sort of advisory template, if one accounted for every possible precaution.  I concur also with MiraLuka, and find the wording of the template slightly paternalistic.

You have requested consultation, I think, because the arguments advanced by your respected opposites appeared insufficient and/or policy-contravening.  I do believe their arguments have great strength, despite some flaws.  Examine, for a moment, your comment:

""""If the primary purpose of the template is to aid/advise readers in a humanitarian fashion (as I think it is), then the template exists to serve goals that are, IMHO, wholly unencyclopedic and irrelevant to the project (the death of a few readersor even valuable contributorsand the concomitant bad press is likely to have only a de minimis deleterious effect on the project)""""

From the record, I see that you registered with Wikipedia in late-December 2005; as such, you may not be familiar with the facts (and the turmoil) surrounding John Seigenthaler, Sr.  In that instance, a single false assertion (albeit a very significant one) garnered for Wikipedia enormous negative press attention, and caused many observers to question the viability and basic premises of the project  a great boon for the Britannica boosters.  The lessons of that episode are numerous, but those applicable here include: 1) The smallest misplaced line of text is a potential danger; 2) Liability for a project in the public eye exists not simply in the law, but even moreso in the press.

It is a sad commentary on the state of the American public that I can easily imagine many readers relying solely on Wikipedia without thinking for themselves.  In most contexts, caveat lector; let them be undone by their ignorance.  In highly visible situations, however, where the press is likely to overextend itself in finding and pillorying any """"villian,"""" no matter how remote the causation, or how unjustified the charge, Wikipedia must take care.  This is an encyclopedia first, but also a non-profit foundation existing on donations.  As editors, we have a duty to protect the reputation of the project.

This raises a second point.  There is a rhetorical error in your comment cited above that has little to do with logic, except perhaps the logic of human psychology.  Large groups are rarely coldly analytical, a fact I find unfortunate quite often.  Nevertheless, it is a fact to which a wise persuader should adapt. """"The death of a few readers...is...a de minimis deleterious effect...""""  This sentence is likely to win one more opposition than support, even if it be logical and empirically correct.  Those who think first from emotion might well react to such sentiment with alarm.

On the precedent of Seigenthaler, I understand why your opposition is showing extraordinary caution when confronting the spectre of a possible high-visibility """"press event,"""" ie. natural disaster.  Given your rhetorical misstep, I understand also why you might fail in this argument, even if the opposition were meritless (thankfully, they are not so.)  On balance, you are probably more correct; the case is not unambiguous, though.  Policies and guidelines exist as principles to be applied by the responsible community in its decision-making fora.  Very rarely, an underdeveloped discussion will ignore these principles, in which case, review (and chastisement) are warranted.  More typically, well-meaning editors apply principles as best they can to cases where principles conflict or overlap.  This case is an example of the latter, and you should waste no worry over the result. Best wishes,  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

I and I alone provided for mankind the most powerful machine since the dawn of time. I was foolish to think I'd get a meeting with the president or the Nobel peace prize. I guess I had my little finger cocked the wrong political way when I did it. Since this was known the forces that be have turned their evil cannons of jealousy toward me and ignored every rule in the book, played every unfair card in the book known and made as many unfair ones they could get their hands on to destroy me and steal it and gain credit for themselves on it. You have to decide if you are on the side of truth and life that I intended for this technology to bring or allow those lord high felons to destroy me with unfair and unequally applied rules. Are you going to be a part of that? Why do I say this? Because if I don't stand no honest person will forever thereafter. Have Wikipedia editors blocked William R. Buckley for the admitted first attack here and thereafter continual attacks, one short one and he's back at it,... or blocked SteveBaker for vandalism at all as he continues to do now and do as much damage to me he can? No. Or punished those dealing out blocks to me when they knew I did nothing for political bias? Did Wikipedia give me credit for my work and ban the copyright infringer and ultimate dark and threatening talker Freitas and Merkle  from this place NO! 

Wikipedia's rules clearly allow the publishing of lies from longer standing people of note, no mater how nefariously they slam the up and coming and tell lies far and wide and Wikipedia knowingly lets them. This is a media rag, period. Like any other. There are no real rules when they apply differently to one than another. Further, again, if you are being destroyed by unfair rules you have a Boston Tea party. Get it? It's called """"self defense"""" something you clearly do not understand. The only rule is a fair one and I don't see you or any other here trying to keep them fair in any way form of fashion you are just blowing political smoke. If you did we would not be here. I have not once been treated fairly and I don't see you doing it or anyone here that bothers to hang around here. You speak of rules, then block those that wrongly attacked me first before I even had a chance to play fair. Before I stuck my head out of the womb as a newbie around here. Don't walk away when I am being punished wrongly and you know it and above all don't drag my good name through the mud like a pig would do Mr. media guy. If you treat me fairly, you would be the first, from Larry King to Don and Mike to the Chief of police in Prince William County Virginia who had me arrested five times knowing I was innocent saying I was crazy for just talking about a self-replicator, even with my patent in my hand, gold seal and all (and you won't write of that here, not fairly). You want fair rules start making and enforcing them fairly and changing the unfair ones here starting here and now (but you wont). But most of all punish those who start the transgressions, not those fighting to defend themselves from the initial onslaught. And do not tell me you do not have special preferences around here.

I have contacted every lawyer on the list at the patent office and they will not sue a university professor (to answer you that question). Do me a fair article and you will never hear from me again because I am only here to fight a bad bio attack on me, that is all.

 """"JFK:First Day Evidence"""" 

I looked for information on a book called """"First Day Evidence"""" written by Gary Savage.   Several book reviews noted the following

Mr. Savage is the nephew of a retired member of  Dallas police crime lab who  processed much of the evidence gathered the day of the JFK assassination, Nov. 22, 1963.  Savage located a number of documents and photographs, previously not published that were in official Dallas police files or the personal files of retired police officers.  """"JFK:First Day Evidence"""" consists of those documents and photographs with commentary on the investigative activities of the Dallas police on the day of and shortly after the assassination.  

This book appears to contain good evidence during the critical period.

I wrote the paragraph quoting Lindley that Peter finds puzzling. Bayes' theorem can be expressed in the form

Posterior probability = Prior probability x Likelihood

If the prior is zero then so is the posterior, since zero times anything equals zero. A similar argument applies if the pror is 1. The likelihood is the part which mathematically models the information content of the data. In the case where the prior is zero it makes no difference what the likelihood is, since it just gets multiplied by zero to make zero. So by choosing a prior probability of zero (or one) you cut yourself off from the ability to take on board the informaton contained in the data.

 about draft 

Hi , I like your opinion piece draft!  It's great in providing many quantifications of the promo/commercial articles.  I like how you narrate your WikiProject Poland experience and develop from that.  I like how you call for a major cleanup drive.

At the end, though, you ask the readers to go off separately and do a little bit towards solving the problem.  IMO that is not enough, and you've motivated something bigger, a big cleanup drive, but that should be a lot more.  

Maybe you should compare your proposal to the big drive to address Un-Referenced Biographies of Living People (URBLP)s, a problem that was recognized more and more during 2009, and then blew up in controversy in January 2010, I think it was.  There was one editor deleting them by the hundreds, I think, which made others mad.  And Wikipedia was hammered in the outside news coverage about some salient bad incidents.  The problem was addressed by a big drive, with one element being wp:URBLP Wikiproject's efforts that I happened to join.  The drive was well-focused because there was a known number, 52,000, of unreferenced BLPs in a category, to be addressed, (although there were new ones coming in, and more old ones being discovered of course).  And that one editor agreed to back off, IF the number was reduced by half in six months.  That's my very imperfect understanding of the situation before I joined.  

The drive I participated in worked well.  I tried to help keep focus on the goal, and in several other ways, but some others had far more direct impact than I did.  See Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Unreferenced Biographies of Living Persons/Archive 2#Goal statement.  Every day we could see the current number, and it moving or not, and some big changes were made to reduce the number of new URBLPs coming in, and some other targeted efforts were tried and some clearly made a difference while others did not.  Overall, having the big, numeric public goal that we wanted to meet, and having immediate feedback/gratification in seeing the total category's number change, was key.  It was rewarding and frustrating and a team effort going on, etc., not just a bunch of people working completely separately.  In the end the 6 month goal was finally met though it was very close.  Then I and some others dropped out but the overall problem had been somewhat """"solved"""", and it's been better since, and the number was brought all the way down to 0 effectively, and is at about 2,000 now, I see. 

I'm not saying you should talk much or at all about that URBLP problem and its drive, in your opinion piece. But I think your calling for accurate measurement of the current problem, by a one-month effort to get all of the problematic articles tagged, say, the same way, would be reasonable.  There would have to be an enforceable rule made up, that prevented the paid PR persons from deleting the tags on their articles.  There was something like that with the URBLPs...I think anyone seen deleting the URBLP tag was warned and blocked as disruptive if necessary.  And then you can call for something aggressive:  like bringing the """"real"""" number down to 100,000 tops within a year, or whatever.  Your estimating the problem size to be 150,000 is helpful towards setting that up.  Or you could call for something quite different.  My main reaction, anyhow, was that I expected at the end for you to call for something big.  Asking people to separately make efforts that would not even be measurable, would not be enough, IMO.  You've earned the right to call for a bigger more organized effort.

Also I'm not sure """"Spam"""" is the right title.  You do clarify you don't mean external links spamming, but that's what I think of.  What is the right name for this problem?  You have the opportunity to name it, maybe, perhaps some acronym.  Business Puff Pieces By Paid Editors Probably = BPPBPEP?  Nope.  The problem is talked about at Talk:Jimbo Wales and elsewhere, though, and there may be a good name for it already.

Hope this helps...my two or three cents.  I'll get to the other thing i owe, but probably not until the weekend or next week.  ncram """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Perhaps it would make sense to move some of the stuff from Terrorism against Arabs back here, if we came to having 2 distinct articles once again? For instance, Lord Moyne was not much of an Arab (though they were his favorites, I guess), so his assassination by Stern gang belongs more to Israeli terrorism Uriyan

 Facts about Israel (note that many of the statements on this page are disputed)

With all the due respect, I don't think this link should be applied on this page, for several reasons:
 It is not about Israeli terrorism, but about general Israel-bashing
 It contains mostly incomplete and partial information. For instance, the green Palestinian number plates was something they asked for. Israeli Arabs have regular yellow plates, and because of that are sometimes targeted by Palestinian gunmen.
 Many of these statements deserve a proper discussion, in Wikipedia, not out of it.  Uriyan

The USS Liberty incident is generally thought to have been an Israeli mistake.

 The USS Liberty was a US Navy ship. It was flying a Navy ensign. It had guns on it. Since it wasn't civilian, engaging it at sea does not have anything to do with terrorism, and has no place on this page, which is about terrorism. Uriyan

 Uriyan

This sentence has been removed from the article about Kach. """"They have also organized murders and beatings of Palestinians in the U.S.""""
 Really?  Who?  

I too am curious about this claim. It is so vague and undocumented that it does not belong in the article. Can someone provide specific claims, and a few sources for us to check out? Also, I do not understand what this has to do with the government of Israel. I agree that it is theoretically possible for a few fanatic right-wing American Jews to carry out such a thing. But (A) there is only a vague allegation being made, and (B) this has nothing to do with the Israeli government, nor the pre-Israel proto-state in the British Mandate of Palestine. We can't simply lump all crimes done by Jewish people into the category of """"Israeli terrorism"""". All crimes committed by Arabs considered Palestinian terrorism (No.). 

Unless these acts were committed by agents of the government of Israel, why are they listed as """"Israeli terrorism"""" instead of """"Jewish terrorism""""?  ~~

I'd tend to agree with Zoe here about the title of the article being wrong. Since it's so """"controversial"""" coming up with a universally-acceptable definition of """"terrorist"""" vs. """"freedom fighter"""", maybe we should just have """"Violence against Israelis"""" and """"Violence against Palestinians"""" pages, or some such?

 Such pages exist (at least for Palestinians), but nobody bothers to update them. It's much less sexy than """"Israeli terrorism"""". 

Then maybe this should redirect to """"Violence against Palestinians"""" (after moving the content of this page & its Talk there, of course)?

The page I had in mind was Palestinians killed by Israelis, but I support leaving """"X terrorism"""" pages, because of the difference between spontaneous violence and pre-calculated killing, which is terrorism. 

Actually, I was thinking of very neutral titles (such as the """"violence"""" ones above), chucking in all the text from any non-NPOV-titled articles scattered about (they can be smoothed out later) and redirecting to the neutral-titled articles. It should make NPOV easier to maintain. I'd lose the """"terrorism"""" pages entirely in the process (dumping their text & talk into the new articles), as we're never going to agree on which acts are """"terrorism"""" and which are not (and you know we're not, yeah?). If the articles just give the facts then we can leave """"terrorism or not?"""" decisions up to the readers.

 Having considered the concept, I support it. In the text itself, we would then have the freedom to describe which actions exactly can be considered terrorism and by whom. 

(bloody hell, did we just agree on something, Uri? Will wonders never cease?)

 Yes, we did agree, and I'm glad at it. I hope it'll be a good beginning for tomorrow - I've got to log out now.

Henry Allingham
Welcome to Wikipedia!

As you can see from the history of the Henry Allingham article, there is some debate about whether the date of birth should be linked. May I suggest that you look at Talk:Henry Allingham to follow and contribution to the discussion?

Although I understand your arguments, I am surprised you don't understand mine.  I don't find it labyrinthine, or at least not particularly so.  (Not more than many other events and aspects concerning the Beatles.)  Nor is the interpretation in question in any way obscure, since it can be taken from any number of texts on the Beatles.  However, though I support the original author's intent here, I guess you and I are going to have to agree to disagree over this point for now.  At some point, however, I will source his/her statements  as soon as I find time to delve into the texts  just because I would appreciate reaching some sort of accord with you.  Until then, I don't think we will make much more progress on this.
 

[The problem with something like this is that there is no absolute truth.  But to me, discrediting the original author's intent is like a dog biting its own tail.  From wikipedia: re. Abbey Road being the final album or not:Abbey Road is the eleventh official album recorded by The Beatles. Although its release preceded that of Let It Be, it was the last album to be recorded. 
...
After the near-disastrous sessions for the proposed Get Back album (later retitled Let It Be for release), Paul McCartney suggested to producer George Martin that the group get together and make an album """"just like the old days. .. just like we used to,"""" free of the conflict that began with the sessions for The White Album. Martin agreed to this if the band would be """"the way they used to be."""" In their interviews for the Beatles Anthology series, the surviving band members stated they knew at the time this would very likely be the final Beatles' product, and therefore they agreed to set aside their differences and """"go out on a high note.""""re. the position of """"The End"""":""""The End"""" was initially intended to be the final track on Abbey Road, but it is followed by """"Her Majesty"""". In the first practice mix of the medley, constructed on 30 July, """"Her Majesty"""" followed """"Mean Mr. Mustard""""...

...etc.  This labyrinth has already been walked through a thousand times by a thousand people.]

A rationale for peremptory norms?
Concerning this paragraph from the article, especially the last sentence,
Some peremptory norms define criminal offences which are considered to be enforceable against not only states, but individuals as well. This has been increasingly accepted since the Nuremberg Trials (the first enforcement in world history of international norms upon individuals) and now might be considered uncontroversial. However, the language of peremptory norms was not used in connection with these trials - rather the basis of criminalisation and punishment of Nazi atrocities was that civilisation could not tolerate their being ignored, because it could not survive their being repeated.
The notion of that which civilization will not tolerate because it cannot survive its repetition, seems the very cogens of jus cogens: how can Nuremberg assert a criterion so relevant to jus cogens, and not be said to have used the language of peremptory norms?   This seems offered as an enduring standard, not a one-off. What evidence do we have of how the legal novelty suggested in the paragraph was perceived or discussed by either the participants or later analysts? 

On a separate point, I don't have a date for the language quoted in the paragraph, wouldn't it be towards the end of Nuremberg's 1945-1949. I wonder whether it somehow echos in """"The Constitution is not a suicide pact,"""" which was from a (later?) 1949 dissent.

I wholeheartedly disagree with your stance on the subject, I believe there is ample evidence to prove the company under the supervision of the CEO in question was not only described constructively but accurate. Terry Semel has ran a company which has gave money to lobby groups which wish to alter the design of the internet to favor profit over ingenuity. This would effectively change the measure for which code is ranked since it would also be determined by its purchased bandwidth priority over performance. This would not only have an effect on those involved in the programming industry but change the way the internet works for the entire world. Now from Wikipedia's own article on the subject an asshole is slang described as """"The word is mainly used as a profanity towards someone the speaker does not like or whose behavior is hurtful, self-centered, or particularly abrasive."""" Now selling out the free world wide accessible library and programming performance for profit is particularly """"self-centered"""" and """"hurtful"""" behavior which influences everyone reading wikipedia. Since this was done during his career this is where I summarized quite eloquently using words from the culture he himself propagates. I just hope to encourage you to look beyond your preconceived notions and defining vandalism by those terms.

Try as I might, I'm not really able to associate your Zebra analogy with this article. For it to work, this would have to be an article about the colour white, and even then it doesn't really work. The purpose of my change is to remove the """"comparison"""" nature of the section. It's not meant to be a comparison to begin with. The problem right now is that the section really violates NPOV - it places weight on a comparison with another format, rather than standing by itself. The fact it mentions Blu-ray means we have a somewhat unnecessary argument going on in the Talk: pages about a graph which is exclusively focussed on comparing Blu-ray and HD DVD studio support. 

To be NPOV, this part of the article needs to focus on what support HD DVD has. Issues such as what proportion of the studios support it are obviously relevant. Issues as to whether they support either of the competing formats (incumbent DVD, as well as Blu-ray) aren't really, except insofar as it should be mentioned that the rivaly exists.

We need to move the fanboi """"HD DVD is better"""", """"No, Blu-ray is better!"""", """"Well, HD DVD has more support!"""", """"No, Blu-ray has more support!"""" crap to the comparison articles.   18:13, 21""",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

The statements in the lead are not only non-neutral, they are slanderous:

The first sentence frames the quote """"wanting to play the game too much"""" as a direct quote from the EA spokesperson, which is false. It is nowhere to be found in the original statement; this is in fact Destructoid's interpretation. The second sentence victimizes the users. This does not belong in the article, let alone the Lead.

Krishnendu das aka Babukishan comes from an old and very traditional Baul folklore family. His grandfather, Guru Shri Nabani Das Baul, was a much celebrated singer and poet that was instrumental in bringing the Baul culture to fame with the respected and admired status it enjoys today. Nabani Das Baul often collaborated with the writer of India's National Anthem, a great poet, and winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913, Rabindranath Tagore. In popularizing the music of the Baul. 

Nabani Das Baul opened the doors for his people to the world. In keeping with this tradition. Babukishan's father, Samrat Purna Das Baul, a modern, popular legend among the Bauls, opened up the doors even further by collaborating and jamming in live performances with the top Western and European acts of the 20th century. Babu is a music designer, singer, and author renowned in India for his work in both the recording and film industries. He plays a variety of music combining new age, and world fusion, with traditional folk music in authentic Bengali Baul style
Babukishan began his career as a performer by accompanying and studying the arts with his father, Purna das Baul. He also participated in numerous youth folk festivals, traveling to places such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok, Great Britain, all of Europe, the United States, and Canada. He played with both the Asian Performing Arts Festival at the Royal Albert Hall in London and the Worldwide Youth Festival in Carnegie Hall in New York.

From this beginning, he traveled most of the world from 1980 to 2000 as a composer, music instructor,musician. and singer.

Babukishan, deeply inspired by his Father and Grandfather, knew at an early age he too wished to compose and perform. He began on the soil of Bengal but clearly he was destined to belong to the world of music. His journey started in early childhood when he joined his mother, Manju Das, and his father, Puma Das, playing and singing Baul music in global festivals. Despite the many world tours, Babu also found the time to study Indian philosophy and Folk music at the University of Kolkata where he eventually secured both his BA and Masters degrees. 

So it was that his formal professional career in music began with his family. He toured with Bob Dylan's The Band East & West tour in 1985. In addition, Babukishan has performed with other international artists such as Alice Cooper, Rolling Stones,Tom Petty, Miles Davis, Allan Fakir, George Harrison, Herbie Mann, Third World, Robbie Robertson, Garth Hudson and many others. 

Though the subsequent years, Babu put this solid foundation in music to good use by composing and performing in all areas of India's entertainment industry as well as in a variety of venues worldwide. Then, in keeping with his early dreams of a unique style of his own, he turned to the music of the western world that he had become so familiar with in his early years of performance. His use of Baul & Indian rhythms combined with the Reggae produced his own brand of World Music-Babu's New Age, Bengali Folk Fusion is the result. 

Babukishan has also worked with top Indian musicians/singers and music directors such as R.D.Burman, Ravi Shankar, Sultan Khan and Zakir Hussain. 

As a composer, Babukishan has written the music for several albums, TV serials and films, earning a good reputation as one of the most promising composer in the Bollywood (Indian cinema) music & film industry of India. In his recordings, Babukishan features folk music, romantic songs, pop songs, ghazals, Qawwali music, new age, fusion, Sufi music and bhajans (devotional/spiritual songs). He is the first singer and music composer from the rich Baul family tradition to venture into fusion music by combining Baul/Sufi music with western music and reggae music. Babukishan produced and directed two documentary films about folk music and he wrote a book titled The Bauls of Bengal. One of Babukishan's latest projects is the band """"Birds"""", which he founded. It combines new age, world music/traditional folk and fusion music. His album Soulmate"""" (Universal/Music India) creates a unique new generation music worldwide.and his latest album, Birds & soul mind & body are based on Baul/Sufi music.""""GYPSYINDIA"""" is authentic traditional baul & sufi music written/composed and all the instruments played by him.this album recored at woodstock,newyork during his tour on 2004.

 Facts

She posts to the arbcom page in green text: FoF perfectly normal. Arbcom pages are like little rainbows.
At the end of a talk page post about the green text, Bishonen suddenly decides to refer to it as """"dye"""":  FoF Not at all forced or contrived. Lots of people refer to text as dye. Or if they don't, they should do.
Bishonen ends her post with  """"Green dye!"""" which reads as """"Green die!"""": Fof Pure coincidence. Nina Green couldn't have been further from Bishonen's mind when she wrote """"Green dye!"""". Bishonen hadn't though of Nina Green for at least 30 seconds.

FOF: This entire sequence events: Bishonen wants Nina banned, gets what she wants, posts in green text, decides to call text """"dye"""", and ends her post for no apparent reason with """"Green dye!"""" is just a random bubble of billion-to-one-coincidence.

Dear Ronz,

PSB the embedded links and the areas which I am trying to update: 

1. The multi-stage fitness test, also known as the bleep test, beep test, pacer test, Leger-test or 20-m shuttle run test, is used by sports coaches and trainers to estimate an athlete's VO2 max (maximum oxygen uptake). The test is especially useful for players of sports like rugby, soccer, Australian rules football, hockey, netball, handball, tennis, squash and fitness testing at schools and colleges plus many other sports; employed by many international sporting teams as an accurate test of Cardiovascular fitness, one of the all-important """"Components of Fitness"""". This test is also part of the FITNESSGRAM - Commercial Link, incorrect and unrelated to the Multi-stage Fitness Test physical fitness test to measure cardiorespiratory - Typo fitness. The test was created by Luc Leger, University of Montreal[1] published in 1983, """"A Maximal Multistage 20m Shuttle Run Test to predict VO2 Max"""", and was re-published in the European Journal of Applied Physiology (vol 49 pp 1–12) in 1988 in its present form with 1 min stages under the name """"Multistage 20-m shuttle run test for aerobic fitness"""".[2] Result equivalences between slightly modified versions are well explained by Tomkinson et al. in 2003.[3] The beep test world record is 19.2, held by Håkan Mild.[4][unreliable source?] - Embedded Commercial Link LAZYRUNNER added as Reference

2. The Multi-stage Fitness Test is know as both the beep test and bleep test, the broken links for the beep article are irrelevant to the content of the Multi-stage Fitness Test article as it discusses both.

I look forward to hearing from you via PM.

 The executive branch shall construe Title X in Division A of the Act, relating to detainees, in a manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the President to supervise the unitary executive branch and as Commander in Chief and consistent with the constitutional limitations on the judicial power, which will assist in achieving the shared objective of the Congress and the President, evidenced in Title X, of protecting the American people from further terrorist attacks. Further, in light of the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court of the United States in 2001 in Alexander v. Sandoval, and noting that the text and structure of Title X do not create a private right of action to enforce Title X, the executive branch shall construe Title X not to create a private right of action. Finally, given the decision of the Congress reflected in subsections 1005(e) and 1005(h) that the amendments made to section 2241 of title 28, United States Code, shall apply to past, present, and future actions, including applications for writs of habeas corpus, described in that section, and noting that section 1005 does not confer any constitutional right upon an alien detained abroad as an enemy combatant, the executive branch shall construe section 1005 to preclude the Federal courts from exercising subject matter jurisdiction over any existing or future action, including applications for writs of habeas corpus, described in section 1005.

A yuga, or mahā-yuga, consists of 4,320,000 years, and one thousand such mahā-yugas constitute one kalpa. The author of Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta says that if one does not take advantage of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he cannot be delivered for millions of such kalpas.""""

However, you are lucky:
Q.    Can Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata be distributed to the common people before they have read the Gita and Bhagavatam?

 

A.    Yes, Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata can be distributed along with the Gita even before Bhagavatam according to Shrila Prabhupada’s purport on Cc Adi 8.36. In the first part of the purport he explains that Shrimad-Bhagavatam is difficult to understand for the common man due to four reasons:

 

(1)  It is very elaborate due to it being the commentary on the the highly condensed Vedanta-sutra and it is in Sanskrit which is a very difficult language to understand for the common man thus few men can understand its purport.

(2)   Professional reciters have created the impression that Shrimad-Bhagavatam deals only with Krishna’s rasa-lila and thus presented Krishna as a great woman-hunter.

(3)  Professional reciters have introduced bhagavata-saptaha, or seven-day readings of the Bhagavatam.

 

Then Prabhupada explains that under these circumstances, it is a great aid for the common man to read Shrila Vrindavana dasa Thakura’s Chaitanya-bhagavata, for thus he can actually understand devotional service, Krishna, Lord Chaitanya and Nityananda. Due to misunderstanding Shrimad-Bhagavatam, people are misled regarding the science of Krishna. However, by reading Shrila Vrindavana dasa Thakura’s book one can very easily understand this science.

          

So it is pretty clear that Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata is a great book to introduce to the common people who normally may not have the required intelligence & patience to understand the most elaborate Shrimad-Bhagavatam

        

Also Shrila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura has said said that Chaitanya Bhagavata is more important than Chaitanya-charitamrita for the common man because it is a lila-grantha. Without describing so much about philosophy, it describes the lila of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and is therefore easy for the common man to follow and understand the philosophy. Even though Sarasvati Thakura himself mostly explained philosophy, he said that philosophy is only for the greatly learned people, and for the common men Chaitanya Bhagavata is more important. So he said, """"Read Chaitanya Bhagavata from time to time."""" If anyone came to him he would ask them if they had read Chaitanya Bhagavata. He often asked people this, including non-devotees. He recommended that for ordinary people, the first Vaishnava literature they read be Chaitanya Bhagavata.

 

Q.Then why did not Shrila Prabhupada explicitly tell us to read this book and distribute it in mass quantities?

 

A.    One immediate answer is because Shrila Prabhupada had not translated the book. Shrila Prabhupada did give great importance to Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s pastimes that is proved by the fact that he left the translation of the Bhagavatam in middle to complete Shri Chaitanya-charitamrita. So actually he did’nt have time to translate Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata. Although Prabhupada has said that his books are enough, he did say that reading Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata will be a great aid for the common man, that one should read this book if he has to preach the gospel of Lord Chaitanya, that readers will profit much by going through Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata (SB Intro). So I would say that it is not against the teachings of Prabhupada to introduce this book with the original Bengali verses & translation to the common people.

 

Q.   But the translation is not done by Prabhupada. So how will we know whether it is bona-fide?

 

A.    Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata is full of very simple but very sweet Bengali verses which are very easy to translate into any language if the devotee translator is  little intelligent and has a little knowledge of Bengali (which is very easy to get). There are very few Sanskrit verses in the whole book and some of them are from the Bhagavatam. For example, translation into Indian languages like Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Telugu etc. is very eas",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Of course there are indeterminates in the real numbers - can you provide a complete representation in *any* number system for those numbers we call irrational? The answer is no. Even if it were possible for 0.999... to equal 1, it breaks the decimal system as it was intended since its invention. Do you agree that not all real numbers can be represented in a radix system? If yes, why would you insist on having a cauchy sequence define a number?  Just because you can list the first few terms says nothing about the limit. For example, you can provide a Cauchy sequence that 'represents' pi but you cannot find its limit. There are several contradictions in this branch of 'analysis' - All Cauchy sequences must have limits but you cannot find the actual limit of 'most' Cauchy sequences that represent the majority of real numbers you cannot represent completely.

You have literally wasted years of your life with this lonely, self-destructive addiction and illness, which has been at the expense of living your own life.  The depth of your mental illness must make it difficult for you to see the extraordinary insanity of your actions and how your addiction has stripped you of the life that was given you.  

I know a few others have evaluated what you do here and laugh at you and your sickness.  It's something of an inside joke, and I guess few share it with you because they consider you hopeless.  That's not right either, and I'd ask them to please stop that and try to help you.  Don't laugh at this person behind their back and then just communicate with them on routine matters.  That lacks all caring for a person who has an obvious and very serious illness. Something is very wrong with him/her, and while it may not be for us to diagnose the exact problem, we should pause to help with advice.  Please share with him/her what we all know.  It's only humane to do so. 

I will do so now too:

Jerzy (or whatever your name isconsciously concealed, I'm sure, to keep your illness as private as possible), please consider some uncomfortable facts:  Years of your life have now been totally consumed and absolutely wasted by your deep, deep sickness and obvious addiction.  Please don't make excuses for yourself.  You cannot go on like this any longer.  You need to stop, and you need to stop today.  Reject this advice, and I worry that your sickness will probably only deepen and your addiction will waste whatever is left of your life.  Please stop.  It's over.  Enough.  Move on.  I do wish you the best and hope you will take this friendly advice seriously.  It will be the first and last time I share it, and I hope you know that I share it only with your best interests in mind.  It's sad what has happened to you, but I wish you good luck and hope this advice is helpful.  But please take itand do so today.  You cannot go on like this.

First, it doesn't contain any actual way to determine what disruption is, meaning that the definition is left to be decided elsewhere (like on the Ref Desk Policy Page).  They then warn that """"...it is tempting every now and then to use the word to refer to certain acts that, while they should not have been committed, do not actually disrupt anything, either. Please try to avoid this.""""  I believe this applies to your characterization of LC's actions.  They certainly were no more severe than """"small-scale vandalism"""": """"For instance, one user gratuitously insulting another user, while inappropriate, is not disruptive.  Neither is simple small-scale vandalism.""""  They then follow up with an example quite similar to what happened with your block of LC:  """"Furthermore, don't cause actual disruption in an effort to fix a perceived disruption. An excellent example of this is the Great Userbox War of 2006; several users who claimed userboxes were disruptive, set about deleting and trying to stop further creation of such userboxes. The ensuing fight was orders of magnitude more disruptive than any supposed disruption for which the userbox opponents were able to provide evidence. Just because you don't like something doesn't mean it is disruption. Disruption is a large-scale hindrance of Wikipedia's ability to function, whether technically, administratively, or socially. An insult, or even a string of insults targeted at several users, does not do this.""""

But this constant BITCHING and whining about political correctness has gone too far. You CANNOT change the Canadian national anthem because it is insulting """"immigrants"""". They're IMMIGRANTS, they CHOSE to come to Canada, and it should be that they should respect OUR traditions -though keeping their customs and traditions, I have nothing against multiculturalism-. We cannot bend over backwards for people who have done nothing for the country! It's like subjecting to bullying, it's not bloody right! And the usage of """"God"""" and """"son"""" means nothing! It's a traditional piece. I am an atheist, and an agnostic, yet I have no objection to prayer in my school's chapel, to singing Christian lyrics, because it pertains no meaning to me. Are not God, Jesus, Allah, Mohammed, Buddha, and ANY other religious deity supposed to all be working for the same cause? Should not they all be """"friends""""??? SO may I ask WHAT is the problem with the Canadian anthem? Allah, Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha and God are all manifestations of the SAME PERSON, THING, CAUSE, REASON! The Canadian anthem is traditional, and it seems to me almost a sacrilege (if you may excuse the poor choice of word, as it seems to contradict my whole speech!) to complain about it being sexist, or bigotry. This ties in with the controversy over the Queen. She is a testament to the tradition of Canada, to remove her would be to follow in the footsteps of the United States. We are not Yanks, we are members of the commonwealth. To get back on track, I state clearly, there is absolutely no logical, moral or respectful way that it can be stated to change the lyrics to a traditional song! A song is a song. You cannot opt to change the lyrics to a controversial popular song, like """"The Beatles""""! You just don't do it! So HOW should it be the same for the anthem? The anthem represents what Canada is. It was established as Christian, and though we gladly accept other cultures, we cannot change every damn thing to be politically correct for all the minorities out there. It's IMPOSSIBLE. Freedom of speech has become the opposite. Comedians can't make jokes about religion, sexuality, gender without being complained at, reprimanded at by minorities. Australia is a perfect example of how a country should be run. They say to immigrants: """"You make the choice to live here. That means you have to live with the way Australians live, Australian code, Australian traditions. Don't come here expecting us to change just for you."""" This is how a country should be. It seems unfair that we should change everything to be politically correct, just so that some bleeding heart out there can go to their bed -Oh, is that politically incorrect to the homeless? I'll change that to """"area of rest""""- and not grumble and whine, prepared to get up the next morning and petition to change all the lyrics of gospel music, or to remove all films that even mention a religious deity in a disrespectful manner. Please, I beg, I PRAY, (God forbid, heheheh) that we all come to our senses and realize """"Don't sweat the small stuff"""". Get on, toughen up, put your helmet on, keep on trucking. It's an imperfect world, you can't have your way all the time. If someone at high school insults you, you ignore it. You stay away from them. SO? Does that not apply to here?

 Midway = turning point 

In my view, if there WAS a turning point in the war on Japan, Midway has to be it. While the Japanese had been stopped at Coral Sea, they still had the initiative; they could still choose where and when to attack, and the allies had to react. But not after Midway! It was, after all, THEY that launched the Midway/Aleutians operation, and THEY that were then rocked back on their heels, and THEY that fled afterward. It was THEY that had lost 2/3 of their big, fast carriers (and the carrier was to the War in the Pacific what the ballistic missile was to the Cold War. Somewhere above someone argues that the remainder of the Japanese fleet was still a formidable force, but that is nonsense; all that force could do would be to sail out and get sunk by a carrier-equipped US NAvy)). Far from being """"merely"""" a tactical victory, it changed the whole complexion of the war. 

Now, while they DID attempt some more offensive action (notably by trying to take Port Moresby, again, this time over land via the Kokoda Trail in the 2nd half of 1942), this was all relatively minor, designed to strengthen their DEFENSIVE positions not to conquer, and was  ultimately almost all unsuccessful. They never again tried the kind of massive, seaborne, combined arms operation that had swept them across most of the Pacific in a just a few months. Then just 2 months after Midway the US landed on Guadalcanal, and clearly the initiative was ours, and Japan was in defensive mode. Thus the Guadalcanal campaign can't be considered the actual turning point either - by then the US was clearly on the attack.

I don't think the argument that there is no turning point because Japan could never have ultimately 'won' the Pacific war works out either. Japanese planners DID know that they could not win a long war MILITARILY but that was not their plan. Strategically their plans went something like: 

1. Start the war from as superior a position as possible (hence Pearl Harbor)
2. Race across the Pacific, seizing resources and territory BEFORE the US could gear up for war.
3. Attain as defensible a position as possible (Hence the Kokoda Trail offensive and takeover of the Solomons) and DIG IN.
4. Let the US grind itself down against near impregnable fortresses. 
5.Win a favorable peace settlement when the US tires itself out throwing itself against their defenses.

But they failed at (1) when they didn't sink the US carriers at Pearl Harbor, and only 6 months later Midway signalled the early end of (2). By the failure to take Port Moresby, they also failed at part of (3). They had some hope to succeed at (5); when the bloody costs of both Tarawa and Buna-Gona became known, US public opinion was shaken. Even as late as 1945, many americans found the though of the casualties invading Japan would cost to be appalling.

So, MY conclusion is that Midway WAS *the* turning point in the Pacific. I realize this whole idea of a turning point is rather subjective, but I really think if there was one in the South Pacific, it has to be Midway.

1907704adff9f0c4,"UPittIT Block 

Hi Orangemike,

Hope you are doing well and I appreciate your work here on Wikipedia. I have some questions regarding the block of UPittIT. Although I too have some concerns with this account which primarily are the lack of this editor's responsiveness to numerous warnings of copyright concerns (as Hammersoft had pointed out), and editor's lack of engagement in dialogue regarding these issues. This could be simple misunderstanding of the copyright policy for the editor's user space, but the repeated violations are disconcerting. In fact, I can't be entirely sure that the user account is only one person (a kind of reverse sockpuppetry that makes me uneasy). However, it is my understanding that editors are not in WP:COI solely due to their place of employment or username, but rather because of the issues of POV, reliability and neutrality of their contributions. However, in this case, my particular my concern is the work the editor had done in his or her own sandbox (the now deleted  issues, this had not been demonstrated because all of his/her work (as far as I know) had been confined his/hers user sandbox. The editor was an obvious newbie, and had twice sought feedback (see here and here) and had been responsive to suggestions demonstrated by the removal of pervasive external links, downsizing of the article, rewriting so it was not in violation of WP:NOTDIR, and the addition of outside, neutral third-party references. In fact, although I did not see any of the editor's additions to this particular article since July 7th, in my opinion, it contained useful information, was notable, and was ready to be moved from the user space into Wikipedia proper. Mostly, I would request that this page be restored, as I would like to create that particular article myself and will not be able to duplicate the off-line references from various library science journals that had been inserted. I guess you could say that I primarily lament the loss of this particular article. I would appreciate your thoughts on this issue, and your review of the D-Scribe Digital Publishing article circa the July 7th version as I would like to see if there is anything salvageable from that (sans the copyright violations that Hammersoft elucidated).

 [edit conflict]

 Some good points, which require more thought.  Some initial responses: 
 I don't think """"Ukraine in WWI"""" is suitable, because most of the activity discussed in the article wasn't directly concerned with the war, and the period covered doesn't correspond to the duration of WWI (1914–1918). 
 """"Ukraine after the collapse of the Russian Empire"""" would be better, but it only defines the period in question by what it followed. In contrast, """"in the Russian Revolution"""" is associated with the events covered herein.
 I agree that """"History of Ukraine (1917-1922)"""" is the most neutral, but that is simply because it avoids saying what the article is about. I think readers appreciate being given a clue to the subject of an article when they see the title in isolation.  It would also be good to have a title which can at least occasionally be linked directly, rather than always having to type a piped link: [[History of Ukraine (1917-1922) |Ukraine in the Russian Revolution]].

 The first revolution of 1917 is what starts the events here, and Russian Revolution or Russian Civil War can refer to the greater events up to 1921.  I also think this article requires an earlier section covering events from the 1905 Revolution, but that will take a bit of reading first.

 Is it a problem to associate a Ukrainian history article with the Russian revolution in the title?  Personally, I think it's neutral because it doesn't imply that Ukraine was Russian, but merely refers to the defunct Russian Empire.

 Abusive harrassment of blocked editor 

These related edits on Malik's talk page are inappropriate period, and right after he's been blocked are a violation of our policy against """"dancing on another user's grave"""".  I reverted them.  I could block you, it's the standard thing to do when people abuse blocked editors like that, but I would much prefer you just not edit Malik's talk page again.

Courts: I have been putting all articles dealing with state law and state courts and their judges under the 'foo law' sub-category for each US 'foo' state.  This at least puts everything involving law and its administration in one place.  While the courts are of course part of 'government', in some states their articles were so dominating the government category, that the executive and legislative articles were losing out.  I can certainly see putting a 'see also' notice at the top of each 'government of foo' category to point to the 'foo law' category. 

Communications: Communications, of course, encompasses media, and also telephone (area codes) and mail (zip codes) and internet, etc.  I see no differenece to be made at the US level versus the state level.  Not sure that media is of such overwhelming 
importance at the state level, however, that it needs to be in multiple places or at the state level.

 Wikipedia Neutrality & This Biography Page 

I think it is fairly obvious by now, looking at the enormous amount of commentary over minutia detail over the last few weeks here on Deepak's page, that there is a handful group of editors posting and editing Deepak Chopra's biography here that belong to the Skeptics society and/or are well known Guerilla Skeptics (who have  published videos of their Guerilla tactics on Youtube).  I would not be surprised if some of them are getting well paid for their work.  Their willingness to go to any lengths to ban, harass, or IMO wear-out other contributing editors (who disagree with their view points) and willingness to use whatever tactics they can to promote their Skeptics society Point-of-View of credible scientists like Deepak or Rupert Sheldrake, or Frederic Myers, or Ian Stevenson or even William James, all of which the biographies here on Wikipedia have been modified in a very POV slanted manner (by many of these same small group of editors, sometimes in a very insidious labeling manner, such as calling Deepak Chopra a new-age Guru, or mentioning early on that Ian Stevenson was a """"gullible individual"""" etc.  I really do wonder how Wikipedia can continue to maintain there is any kind of veridical neutrality being practiced here?

I think it would be a good idea to bring in a whole new set of editors (or only allow a new set of editors) come in and rework some of the pages I have mentioned above, without the involvement of the Guerilla Skeptics here.  Perhaps a set of well-known editors that have established themselves on Wikipedia now for many years - could come in, and provide a fair and balanced approach to the biographies of Deepak Chopra, or Rupert Sheldrake, or Ian Stevenson etc.  None of which will be achieved IMO given the obvious agenda that has the foot prints - again of these few, extremely biased and active editors here. 159.118.158.122  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

When I wrote """"75(note 15)"""" above, I should have written """"75([superscript:]??"""" looks like """"25"""" or """"2.5"""" in GBooks' representation. When I looked at this entry on p. 3-366 before, it looked like """"15"""". Also, on """"Explanation of Table"""" p. 3-2, I read
""""The data in the table have many sources, including both the primary literature and evaluated compilations.  The Handbook of Data on Organic Compounds, Third edition (Ref. 7) and the Combined Chemical Dictionary (Ref. 8) were important sources. Other useful sources of physical property data on organic compounds are listed in Refs. 9-19.  The values in the table for the normal boiling point and the melting point that are accompanied with uncertainties (in parenthesis) have been critically evaluated using the NIST ThermoData Engine (TDE, Ref. 20), designed to implement the dynamic data evaluation concept (Refs. 21-24).  This concept requires large electronic databases capable of storing essentially all relevant data known to date with detailed descriptions of metadata and uncertainties.  The combination of these electronic databases with expert-system software, designed to automatically generate recommended property values based on available experimental and predicted data, leads to the ability to produce critically evaluated data dynamically, 'to order.' The uncertainties listed are combined expanded uncertainties (level of confidence, approximately 95 %) representing the most comprehensive measure of the overall data reliability (Refs, 25-28).""""
So this suggests that some temperature values in the table are automatically derived but as I say, the """"25"""" or """"2.5"""" is a raised, reduced-sized font, not parenthesized. So the superscript may well refer to alternate sample pressure - I can't find whatever it references. I apologize if this dwells on this source too much; I think the consensus here that the bp is significantly higher than 75'C is dispositive.

 Oops, I was on the same track but going in the opposite direction. I just put the Ikotos County hook and credit into the now-empty Prep 1. I will take it out of T:TDYK again. We had an edit conflict when you moved Prep 1 to Queue, I was adding yet another French hook to it, since it will by """"up"""" during daylight hours in France on July 14. It is the Picasso hook from the Trocadero Museum; there is already a different Picasso hook in Prep 2. I swapped out the Thomas Thynne hook to make room, and moved the quirky fur teacup to the end of the set. So it looked ike this:


... that Jean Thurel (pictured) was a soldier in the French Régiment de Touraine for more than 90 years?
... that Picasso said he discovered """"what painting was all about"""" after seeing African art in the Paris Musée d'Ethnographie du Trocadéro?
... that detailed drawings by French explorer Louis Delaporte guided the reconstruction of Pha That Luang, a major Buddhist temple in Laos?
... that the world has been divided into 11 constituencies for French residents overseas to vote in the 2012 legislative election?
... that Sam Stein won his first World Series of Poker bracelet at the 2011 World Series of Poker but his largest single-event prize was a  result at the 2011 PokerStars Caribbean Adventure?
... that the vocals in the music of Nier are sung in versions of French, English, and Japanese after 1000 years of language drift?
... that conversation in a Paris café inspired the Surrealist sculpture Object (Le Déjeuner en fourrure), consisting of a fur-covered teacup, saucer and spoon?

Hi Deen maxwell, you've acknowledged that this is your main and preferred account. As you intend using only your named account, I've copied and pasted the following from my talk-page:

(quote) Well you accuse me of vandalising the Liber Linteus , well the interpretation of the Etruscan text is the biggest load of garbage you could pour on the public.The reason I might be coluding  with a second party is when I opened my account with WIKI I made a mistake and entered my e-mail address as my used name, so I had to do it again with the correct user name so it may seem there are two accounts,keep my Deen Maxwell account and delete the other.
My primary interest is in the Etruscan Language which I have been studying for the last 30 years and I dont have the time to transcribe the Encyclopaedia Britannica to your site,although I enjoy using the site.And also you have a log in on the page but not a  Log Out (58.111.89.246 ).(58.111.89.246  ).  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 58.111.89.246   

I don't think I've accused you of vandalism anywhere at all - but if I have, please accept my apologies. Thanks for explaining your inadvertent use of multiple accounts. They're allowed under certain, very limited circumstances. Single accounts are better for continuity, accountability, trust and stability - they help foster and maintain a transparent, open editing environment. This matters particularly when article content and best-editing practice are in dispute. You've evidently made an honest mistake, due to your unfamiliarity with the relevant Wikipedia policies.

Your IP account won't be deleted, as its history is relevant to editing on other pages. You can and should open your IP user-page, using your named account, and enter a brief explanatory text, such as """"This is an alternative account of [your named account signature - add four tildes (~) to sign automatically]"""". Copy the same to the IP talk-page. Then just don't use it. I can't know why you're having problems logging in or out; just remember to always log in using your named account before you edit.

This whole conversation is rediculous as the colors on a flag are meant to represent different ideas or ideals. What we decide to call that color has everything to do with what is meant by that color. By calling it yellow one is neglecting to fully appreciate the meaning behind the choice of gold as a flag color is meant to convey an idea, that of eternal and original wealth and prosperity. It has nothing to do with being high and mighty regarding the naming of a color. That is a reactionary and frankly stupid position to hold. Flags are symbols meant to illustrate various ideas and they use images and colors, like all other forms of symbolism, to do this. Thus, the use of gold on a flag is in no way an attempt to sound more high and mighty, but rather a way to communicate.... you dolt",1,0,0,0,0,0,True

You could also make a case for capitalizing character names rather than using all upper case (e.g. """"Latin Capital Letter A"""" or """"Latin capital letter A"""" instead of """"LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A"""", but in very many cases it would be problematic to decide which words to capitalize and which not, so I would prefer to stick with all upper case character names.

''KM'' is the ''motor constant'' (sometimes, ''motor size constant''), defined as:
:\frac{\tau}{\sqrt{P}}

* \scriptstyle P is the resistive power loss (SI units, W)

The motor constant is winding independent (as long as the same conductive material used for wires); e.g., winding a motor with 6 turns with 2 parallel wires instead of 12 turns single wire will double the velocity constant, Kv, but KM remains unchanged.  KM can be used for selecting the size of a motor to use in an application.  Kv can be used for selecting the winding to use in the motor./

The primary goal of the case based textbook is to inform doctors of what to do when they are asked to perform different medical operations. The case based textbook only has one chapter on circumcision. Its primary goal is to inform doctors of how to react in the case they are asked to perform a circumcision. It does not give an overview of questions that have been raised about the procedure, and doesn't cover sources of controversy in the medical field (only debates). This makes it unfit to speak for this topic. Maybe it would be better to use it to highlight another statement involving controversies in the medical field.

The second source titled Controversies with one author is ok, as it does go over some medical controversies that exist, notably in consent and the parental role.

I think a better sourcing for this statement """"Ethical and legal questions regarding informed consent and autonomy have been raised over non-therapeutic neonatal circumcision.[8][9]"""" would be one that highlights significant questions from community groups in a specific demographic. If we could get a source that is clearly indicating that these questions are being raised that would be better.

 Legislation: European Union 

 The atricle claims: """"The European Union has ratified a law """"banning incitement to or denial of genocide"""" (both the Holocaust and the Armenian Genocide)."""" The source reads: """"The European Union has just ratified a law “banning incitement to or denial of genocide” (arguably including both the Holocaust and the Armenian genocide)."""" Some enthusiasts removed the word arguably when citing the source. 
 Let's have a look at the law itself. 
 Framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia
 Official Press Release
 Certain forms of conduct as outlined below, which are committed for a racist or xenophobic purpose, are punishable as criminal offences: ... public condoning, denying or grossly trivialising crimes of genocide ... as defined in the Statute of the International Criminal Court (Articles 6, 7 and 8) and crimes defined in Article 6 of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal, when the conduct is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred against such a group or a member of such a group.

 Example: Somebody publicly claims that an act of genocide, the commission of which has been established as a fact by an international court, never happened and was invented by the ethnic group concerned solely for the purpose of being able to claim compensation payments. This allegation would not only deny the genocide committed against the ethnic group concerned, but would also incite hatred against this group. In the future, all Member States would be compelled to criminalise such a case.

 Whether a specific historical crime falls within these definitions must be decided in each concrete case by the court which has jurisdiction. In the case of the Holocaust, for example, this was done by the Nuremberg Tribunal.
 As we see, the law is restricted to cases, when:
 the commission of genocide is established by an international court and
 the denial is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred

Hello again. I'll respond to your note on my page a little here. First of all, I don't have a negative attitude towards the Romans, or the Greeks, or the Macedonians or anyone from Western antiquity. I'm really not that interested in Classical history beyond basic knowledge. What I AM interested in is keeping the wiki clean.

As far as having the article locked, it was put into what's called """"semi-protected"""" mode. In semi-protect, anonymous users cannot edit the article, and neither can newly  registered accounts. This is to prevent vandalism from occuring - people putting in nonsense or swearing for no reason, that kind of thing. By the time you read this note you should have had your account long enough that you can now edit the article. I will warn you that trying to put in uncited material or stuff that goes against the manual of style will probably be deleted again, although not by me.

Another suggestion would be to use the Apollo discussion page to air your concerns. Two of the five wikiprojects that have staked a claim on Apollo ( Wikiproject Classical Greece and Rome and  Wikiproject Mythology) are known for their accuracy and attention to detail. They can probably give you reasons for why the content looks like it does. 

One last note, if you want to leave me a message again, please to it here at this link to my talk page, rather than on my main user page. That way I get a note telling me you want to talk to me, rather than having to wait until I stumble across your posting. Either way, good luck.   talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

 sincere reply to Ninlil 
  Dear Ninhil, I thank you very much for intervening... at least this much is accepted by a neutral arbitrator that in case two authors differ in their versions, both versions must be allowed to be retained.  Since you wanted specific instances, in the book named Ancient India (1956) by K.A.N.Sastri, he has stated clearly while describing Rajendra Chola I that among the list of conquests (at one point he stated clearly thus:) 'next was the turn Satyasraya who was defeated and banished out of his capital'.  This can be contrasted with the statement in this Article that Satyasraya was able to control Chola aggression basing his contention on material from author Suryanath Kamath, without commenting on the accuracy of Suryanath Kamath's version, I accept your verdict that both versions should be allowed to be retained.  Dinesh is also erring badly when he writes subsequently in this article about Jayasimha also fighting hard with the Cholas (in fact Rajendra Chola ruled during the time of Satyasraya as well as Jayasimha and has claimed to defeat both) and also goes on to add that both sides lost and won but both K.A.N.Sastri and Rajendra's inscriptions at the Tanjore temple (courtesy the summary of Prof. Huntzsch, noted epigraphist appointed by the Archaelogical Survey of India, a body of the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Govt. of India, whose finds are given in detail at inscriptions.whatsindia.com/ - a site despised unnecessarily by Dinesh Kannambadi as a POV site because its findings go against 'historical events and their conclusions' of his liking) state that he emulated his father in winning the 'seven and a half lakshas of Rattapadi' and where Prof. Huntzsch has clearly arrived at the conclusion (after reading Chola inscriptions from the times of Raja Raja Chola because it was from his time onwards that there were several wars between the Cholas and Chalukyas) that winning seven and a half lakshas of Rattapadi meant winning the war and levying tribute on the losing Chalukya king.  Satyasraya lost twice, once to Raja Raja Chola when the Chola army was led by his son Rajendra and once to Rajendra, who also went on to defeat Satyasraya's successor Jayasimha II and Prof. Huntzsch once again attests the expression by Rajendra Chola I in the inscription at the Tanjore temple, a World Heritage site ': """"the seven and a half lakshas of Iratta-padi, (which was) strong by nature, (through the conquest of which) immeasurable fame arose,[7] (and which he took from) Jayasimha, who, out of fear (and) full of vengeance, turned his back at Muyangi and hid himself"""", as the Chola once again winning the war (this time it was over Vengi with the Chola army first routing the Chalukyas near Rajahmundry and subsequently at Masangi (called Muyangi in the Chola inscriptions in Tamil langauge), causing their king Jayasimha to banish and then levying tribute on the defeated Chalukya.' These have been attested by both K.A.N.Sastri and R.C.Roychowdhuri in their two books of the same name i.e. Ancient India.  

To repeat the above, the author R.C.Roychowdhuri in his book Ancient India borrows heavily by quoting extensively from K.A.N.Sastri - this unfortunately, goes against the thinking of user Kannambadi who is repeating blindly that I have no sources - I can assure you certainly I can read and write. It is very poor in taste, the expression of Dinesh Kannambadi who has gone on to justify my previous blocking, as is evident on my talk page dear Ninhil, this was done by user Blinguen an admin probably, who barged into my talk page and blocked me without giving any reason the second time i.e. he violated two rules of Wikipedia which are being advocated by Dinesh Kannambadi and another clique at work in wikipedia, first they ask people like us, who draw from sources and post at times historical events which are not palatable to them,  that we should first post on the discussion page, but in my case I was straight away blocked on the first occasion by user Blinguen who certainly did not discuss with me on the article discussion page nor did he discuss the topic itself with me.  The second time Blinguen entered my talk page, left a comment that he did not like what I wrote for he thought what I wrote was a personal commentary (when in actuality, it was a summary of Chola historty from which I drew from Prof. Huntzsch's summary from inscriptions.whatsindia.com/ but had made the mistake (I am not shy of admitting I make mistakes) of not posting the source, but before I realized and re-entered the Chola page, I found first that I was not able to edit and found to my horror that Blinguen has arrived at a certain conclusion and blocked me without giving me a chance to explain, discuss or argue with me on the concerned topic and its contents, just as Dinesh Kannambadi is trying to do now by painting anyone whose findings he doesn't like, in black.

 Page vandalised 

Please someone proceed to undo last edit 190.95.22.190  

 this is wrong 

chuck norris was an undefeated karate champion and joe louis was a boxer.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 71.184.71.125   

 How tall? 

Officially he's 5'10"""" but in fact he's more like 5'8"""" from what I could tell. Smells of scandal! His height is an issue because he's an inspiration for tiny little cute guys everywhere. They can live the life of massive impressive physical speciments if they can actually get away with it. Perhaps there should be an entry on people whose vision prevents them from correctly judging people's heights or reading a measuring tape.   

 Junior? 

With a few web searches I couldn't turn up any reference to his birth name including a Jr. that seemed to be independent of and more reliable than Wikipedia.  Also, in his autobiography  he says his father's name is Ray, and the genealogy link  someone has in this discussion page says it's Ray D. Norris.  Also, his father being Carlos and he being Jr. is inconsistent with him being named after his minister, which he also says in his autobiography.  So I changed it.
Also, both the cited NYT article and his book spell his brother's name Wieland.   

 Birth date issue? 

Astrodatabank.com quotes his autobiography for March 10, 1942?? Can someone source the 1940 date?   

 Family man quote is too strong 

Under Personal Life, after detailing how he had a child out of wedlock the following quote shows up:

""""Norris has always been a very loving family man""""

Which uses a People magazine article of him hugging his adult sons as evidence.

This seems to be pretty weak evidence for this assertion.

Fisrt, please use the four tilde thing ~~~~ to sign your posts. It's easier to refer to someone when there's a someone to refer to. Second, I'm not sure what is the problem. Are you saying that having children out of wedlock demeans the """"family man"""" comment? Or that hugging his son is not enough proof? I'm not sure the picture is there to provide proof for the statement (that would be OR and should be eliminated if that's the case). If you don't believe the statement then place a  tag on it and see what turns up. If you could explain more clearly what the problem is maybe I could help further. padillaH (review me)(help me)

a583ff90a5e17de5,""":Kleene (re his (1952) Introduction to Metamathematics) would disagree that metamathematics isn't a topic for mathematics. But Minsky (1967) seems to agree with you, never mind he's not too convincing with his """"intuitive argument"""" using appeals to """"intuitive arguments"""". In his discussion of """"an effective procedure a.k.a. algorithm"""" (his definition, in fact) he says the matter is subjective:
""""Different people may not agree on whether a certain procedure should be called effective. Perhaps there are processes, we might suppose, which simply cannot be described in any formal language, but which can nevertheless be carried out, e.g., by minds. One might even argue that those important, but still mysterious, functions which make minds superior to all presently known mechanical processes must, by their intuitive nature, escape any systematic description.

""""Turing discusses some of these issues in his brilliant article, 'Computing Machines and Intelligence' [1950] .. they amount, in my view, to a satisfactory refutation of many such objections."""" (p. 107)

Minsky goes on to state:
""""One cannot expect to prove Turing's [his name for the Church-Turing] thesis, since the term 'naturally' relates rather to human dispositions than to any precisely defined quality of a process. Support must come from intuitive arguments..."""" (p.108)

Boolos and Jeffrey (1974, 1999) are more constructive:
""""Although this thesis ('Church's thesis') is unprovable, it is refutable, if false. For if it is false, there will be some function which is computable in the intuitive sense, but not in our sense. To show that such a function is computable in the intuitive sense, it would be sufficient to give instructions for computing its values for all (arbitrary) arguments, and to see that these instructions are indeed effective....To show that such a function is not computable in our sense, one would have to survey all possible Turing machines and verify (by giving a suitable proof) that none of them compute that function.... Then if Church's thesis is false, it is refutable by finding a counterexample; and the more experience of computation we have without finding a counterexample, the better confirmed the thesis becomes."""" (italics in original, p. 20)

""""Thus, the sun always rises because the sun has always risen."""" Truth by enumeration: animal logic. Bertrand Russell would have a field-day. At least Boolos and Jeffrey offer us a """"road map"""" of how to go about approaching the problem. But they fall into the same trap: they are asserting that if a computational procedure isn't mechanical then it must be intuitive. Say what? that the world of computation is divided into two mutually-exclusive sets: """"the intuitive"""" and """"the mechanical""""? Sure sounds like dualism to me ... intuitive 'minds' with 'souls' vs 'brains'made of gooey mechanical stuff ... interesting... most (but not all) philosphers of mind have given up on 'souls' ... maybe here is how one disproves or proves dualism? To wit: 

What would be interesting would be if someone could prove that the truth of the Thesis is formally undecidable in any construct whatever, """"intuitive or otherwise"""" forever unknowable to man or machine or God. One little [dualism] difficulty: what the hell does 'intuitive' really mean? [maybe that God is punching holes through the 5th dimension into our 4-D space-time, and is seeding minds with """"notions"""" (but not mechanically altering them in the process)?] 

I would call this sort of discussion a 'foundations of mathematics' debate, and therefore an open topic in some domain or other. Whether its 'philosophy' or 'foundations of mathematics' I don't know. I think they are the same.  wvbailey

I'ld like to retrieve one small item from the above hidden stuff. Martin's remark """"the answer is 2/3"""" and mine, """"no, the answer is switch"""". I did not mean to imply that the 2/3 should be made completely invisible. Of course one must emphasize that a good *reason* to switch is because the probability is 2/3 that you'll get the car this way. It is even a very very good reason to switch, since it is can be shown (if all doors are initially equally likely to hide the car) that you can't do better; in particular, complicated strategies of sometimes switching sometimes staying depending on specific door numbers lead to a smaller chance of success! (Morgan et al; Gill).

I hoped that this remark of mine would help show that by careful choice of words it's possible to write sentences which many more editors could agree with. And which everyone can agree are not misleading and which everyone can agree reflects what is in the literature.

Remember: Vos Savant and Whitaker ask what the player should do. Introducing probabilities into the story is one way of finding justification for an action. The phrase """"the probability"""" leads straight to controversy, at least to disagreement (both among editors and in the literature). The phrase """"what action should the player take"""" leads to concensus (both among editors and in the literature).

As Q proceeded down the article, he started deleting entire paragraphs, etc. So we stepped in per WP:BRD… That got his attention. Q decorated the article with top-level tags.  We started discussion, change by change. Q is fundamentally a well-read humanist. He has a theory of science based on his voluminous reading and training in history. So we have a difference in perspective which I would like to explore with Q and incorporate in the article. I attempted to get him to formulate his POV but Q's responses became attacks,  so I called Time out. To me, this proves Q is well-meaning, but Q also has strong opinions which I am attempting to draw out, somehow, without sacrificing the article.   The article remained tagged for over a month. The article is basically back to the Jan 1 state, but it also includes Tetrast's latest improvements.
Qs reasoning boils down to 'There was Science thousands of years ago. Therefore there was scientific method thousands of years ago', which does not follow.

I'm entitled to point out that and I am entitled to ping your editor about it.

Under the """"Ford Airplane Company"""" section, Alclad is stated to be a """"new alloy ... that combined the corrosion resistance of aluminum with the strength of duralumin"""" This is incorrect.

 About archiving 

My apologies for reverting you on that, but please see User talk:Ben MacDui#Archive, where we already went back and forth on the same thing.   
So you did - apologies I didn't see it. I only partially archived it and there seems to be a clear consensus developing - if you pardon the circularity! - in favour of consensus/70% but definitely not 30% or majority. Given the number of """"partial support"""" comments I think we actually need a new proposal - care to help me draft one? (Talk) 
To tell you the truth, I really have no expectation that the snowy ones are going to go any differently than they already have. I just want to get as many editors as possible weighing in on this particular point, and I think the most unbiased results will come from seeing all the options together. My advice would be to improve what we've got, not to start over from scratch. But I'll definitely lobby hard that we really fix up the one we've got, not just plug in poll results mindlessly, and I'm pretty confident we'll have agreement to do that.

Without this note, I would believe that this was intentional, but with your note, it seems that you are just missinformed by anti-OSS people like Eduard Bloch... Let me explain in detail:
 The text in the mentioned diff does not belong into the licensing section at all. It may be a candidate for the critisizm section on the Debian article (to explain problematic behavior of Debian against cdrtools, firefox, ...) after it has been corrected to reflect the truth.
 The named text tries to belittle cdrtools with false claims, so let me give the correct background information:
 All CD/DVD/BD drives ever made are SCSI devices.
 ATAPI is just one of many SCSI transport mechanisms and while ATAPI is fully integrated into the SCSI stack on Solaris x86 since 1993, this was not the case on Linux in 2004. This is a design problem on Linux.
 Cdrtools is highly portable to ~ 30 different platforms (not counting different CPUs separately) and the man page mentions that it grants equivalent behavior on all supported platforms
 The vast majority of all platforms do either not have device nodes at all or do not have a 1:1 relation between a specific device node and a specific SCSI device. Win-DOS and Mac OS X both do not have device nodes for SCSI devices, so 99% of all computers in the world cannot use device node based SCSI addressing.
 3) and 4) make it obvious that you cannot use device nodes in a portable implementation and that only the official SCSI addressing scheme is portable across platforms.
 In September 2004 Linus Torvalds introduced a fatal Linux kernel SCSI interface incompatibility while claiming to fix a security bug. This incompatibility was introduced exactly when a new stable cdrtools relase was puiblished after a long time of bug fixing and code freeze in cdrtools.
 The patches from Debian (Eduard Bloch) that you seem to reference and that have been published in 2004 are full of bugs. In Spring 2005, there have been aprox. 150 unique bug reports against cdrtools  in the bug tracking systems of various Linux distros. Nearly 100 of these bugs have been a result of the patches from Eduard Bloch. The other 50 bugs have been fixed in the original code between September 2004 and August 2006 after Debian stopped updating their source. BTW: As there is no development activities on cdrkit since May 2007, the vast majority of these 150 bugs is still present in the defective and dead fork from Debian. In special, there is no code in the Debian fork that works around the SCSI interface incompatibility mentioned in 6).
 cdrtools is a really openminded project. Any patch that was send and that follows the quality requirements in the CONTRIBUTING rules has been accepted. The patches from Eduard Bloch did not follow the quality rules. The cdrtools project does not accept patches that harm the code - sorry, but this is needed if you like to give long term support for a program. Note that the first libscg code was written in August 1986 (28 years ago) and that I have other OSS (e.g. star) that is maintained since 32 years.
This list of explanations can be found in the internet if you use a search engine...I did write it many times in similar wording in the past after people came up with similar false claims.
Please also note that the fork from Debian was started in May 2004 - 10 years ago. When Debian claimed to start their cdrkit fork in late 2006, they did just change the name on my request. So this cdrkit includes all bugs that have been introduced by Debian since early 2004. Cdrkit did never publish a release that has no known bugs at the time of being published, so cdrkit did never raise above alpha-release quality.

 List of mycologists 
Thanks for creating the list of mycologists.  The only thing that might be missing is the author abbreviation.  I have been linking a lot of those lately in the mushroom articles.  

I noticed that the botanists have everything set up pretty well - They have a list of botanists with abbreviations and also a template to make it easy to put a box in an article that gives the abbreviation info.

I copied it and changed a couple words - Now we have:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Mycologist

I tried it out on Gaston Guzman.  

There are still some red links, I haven't decided if I should reword the template or add the articles that are in red.

What do you think?

 

I can see the advantage of having author abbreviations included on the list of mycologists, and I can't see the harm of a separate  to parallel , although since mycology falls under the ICBN, all mycologists are, in some sense, botanists (and many were both, particularly in the early days), so the links in the template should lead to author citation (botany) and botanical name. We should not expect a separate article on """"author citation (mycology)"""" to be created, since mycological naming is botanical naming, even if the organisms aren't plants.  

 Melolonthinae 

Thanks for fixing the errors I made in creating Melolonthinae. I took a leap creating it since I have zero practical knowledge of the subject. Hey this is totally random, but I figure you might know a thing or two about biology as a whole. Why does Canis lupus familiaris cover everything from a chihuahua to a great dane yet other animals with very minor variations (ex. Oncorhynchus mykiss gairdnerii, Oncorhynchus mykiss newberrii) are distinct subspecies?   C T 

The species is normally defined as a group of """"actually or potentially interbreeding populations"""" (the biological species concept), which means that if two animals can interbreed to produce fertile offspring, they are considered conspecific. Subspecies are defined more vaguely, as divisions of a species which are not different enough to prevent interbreeding, but which have fairly constant differences. I don't know what the morphological difference between O. m. newberrii and O. m. gairdnerii is, but I am sure there is one. The unusual situation is Canis lupus familiaris, which has been subject to artificial selection, and so exhibits much more physical variation than is normal for taxa of such limited genetic isolation. I am not sure whether it is really valid to apply scientific names to domestic dogs and the like in the first place, although it is widely done; perhaps it represents the scientific name of the wild taxon from which the domesticated breeds are derived. By contrast, cultivated plants have their own system of nomenclature, separate from the ICBN.

I assume his reasoning for the undo was because the added info contained Gogs projected involvement in Final crisis (something that seems obvious, but has not been officially announced.  I removed all predictions and made the added info stick to only the facts given in JSA #14.  I did like the addition of the fact that the origin of Gog in pre-infinite crisis does not match this current version.  Now that the addition has been fixed, I hope that anyone who edits this adds two it and does not simply revert it.  If you do revert something, explain your reasoning so we don't get into and editing war.  Thanks   
 
It is important to note that there have been three different origins for Gog. And all three characters made it to the main D.C. continuity.  His Hyperspace spanning, Time traveling, Multiverse jumping nature makes this character inherently hard to grasp when looking at the multiverse or even just the main DC universe. 
     
First, from the Kingdom Come timeline:  He Survived Kansas's destruction. Given powers by the Quintessence, he stole Superman and Wonder Woman's baby, went back through Hypertime killing Superman over and over again.  He was defeated in the Main DC continuity by Kingdom Come and main versions of the heroes.  

The second version of Gog was basically a homage to the first, but without the tricky use of Hypertime and the Kingdom come continuity.  He survived Topeka's (only) destrucion.  He kept going back in time and advancing his work over and over.  This Guy made it into the pages of Superman comics.  

The third version is the one in the current run of JSA.  He claimed he was got his power from Gog, Last God of the Third World.  And he complained about all of kansas being destroyed.  This origin actually resembles the first more than the second.  This makes it likely that he is from Earth-22, like the superman in JSA.  It is common for the new 52 Earths to resemble previous DC comic's Elseworlds, but have some differences.  It has already been shown that Earth-22 resembles Kingdom Come, but has some slight differences.  This explains the Kansas destruction being the same, but the change in his power source being from quintessence to a Third World god. Although time will tell if this is right, it does seem like the logical conclusion.  Someone can add this to the article when it is revealed in the pages of JSA.   

To answer the above question, the Quintessence were fooled.  Phantom stranger thought that this man, who came out of the Kansas massacre, and started a Superman Church, would be a good representative of the values that the quintessence hold. But they were mistaken (gods a fallible in comics).  The guy snapped after getting the powers, went a little nuts, and killed Superman over and over.  The quintessence decided not to take back their power, but I am not sure if they explained why.",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

If it helps, the insult was directed at you, the other fellow who agreed to remove the images, and a large percentage of the editors at Wikipedia, who spend more time citing rules than actually making substantial contributions.

Here, Toby72 asked me to take a look at this. Here is what I saw in a not-so quick look at recent edits.
This 14 April version of the article had an initial paragraph in the Colonia Era section which was largely unsupported.
In this 15 April edit, Toby72 replaced this paragraph with new content, still largely unsupported. The new content changed the focus of the paragraph, removing a heavy weight previously given to rape in a master/slave relationship in favor of heavier emphasis on mulatto offspring.
In this series of three April 15 edits, DD2K reintroduced the emphasis on rape, citing supporting sources.
In this 15 April edit, Tobby72 reverted the DD2K edits, saying """"WP is not a blog"""".
In this 17 April edit, Tobby72 added and rearranged some material.
In this 17 April edit, anon 69.105.28.149 reverted the article back to its state as of the last edit by DD2K, without explanation.
In this edit, apparently not noticing that the article had been anonymously reverted to one of his prevvious edit versions, DD2K made some further edits to the article, saying, """"Undid revision 550678046 by Tobby72 (talk)Not weighted properly. Vast majority of scholars(and obvious common sense) state slave/master 'relationsips' were rape by the very nature"""".
In this May 3 edit, Toby72 added and removed some material in this and other sections of the article. saying, """"readd quotes per WP:NPOV, plus add pics"""".
In this May 3 edit, DD2k reverted the prior edit by Tobby72, saying, """"...  rv- stop- If you want to make these kinds of controversial changes, use the Talk page.""""
In this May 3 edit, Toby72 added a  tag to the section.

I think I've got that straignt. Some of the edits mentioned above were separated from one another by unrelated edits made by other users.

Guys, please re-read WP:BRD. I know that it is an essay and not a policy, but it does describe a workable method for reaching consensus by identifying objections to edits and keeping discussion moving forward and help towards breaking deadlocks. That Bold-Revert-Discuss method is much superior to the Bold-Revert-Unrevert-Edit war method which has been tried here. Regardless of how the section at issue got to be in its current state, can we please have some discussion aimed at establishing a consensus about what it ought to contain?

It looks to me as if the main area of disagreement is how much weight should be given to information about master-slave rapes in colonial America in an article on the topic of Mulatto, which the lead sentence describes as, """"a term commonly used in the United States to refer to a person who is born from one white parent and one black parent, or more broadly, a person of any 'mixed' ancestry."""" Input from editors not involved in the edit-warish exchanges above would probably be useful. I'll mention that this source might be useful.

 Communism, The CRC, Robeson and the Civil rights movement 

As this is a survey and there was zero mention of the CPUSA and the many battles they fought in the pre-1955 era, I feel that history warrants the inclusion. To call the CRC a """"fringe"""" group is to show a paucity of history of what led up to 1955. Civil Rights historians have been scared and embarrassed or ignorant regarding the huge amount of work that Communists, The CRC, Robeson did vis a vis groups such as the CRC. This history is documented and it is CIVIL RIGHTS HISTORY even if Eyes on The Prize left it out. Also not all the members were Communist many were the same folks who went on marches and who were suffering injustices in small KKK towns in the South.

 I totally agree with you that it is nonsense to classify heterogenous nomadic confederations in Asia as """"one particular ethnic group"""". The Huns, the Hephthalites, the Rouran, and even the Turks and Mongols were coalitions of a bunch of different nomadic tribes of all kinds of origins - from Indo-Iranian Scythians to Siberian proto-Altaics. Yet, we have to have SOME standard in here. And the best way to do that is to stick to authoritative sources. 
 The EI and EIr are collections of major sources and quotes; both Ei and EIr make clear that neather the Chionites nor the Hephthalites (or Gök-Turks) were homogenous. As for the Hephthalites, the usage of Mongolian and Turkic titles (such as Khaqan) is attested in the scripts of Bactria. Yet, the ruling elite was most probable of Eastern Iranian origin. That's why Chinese sources, such as the """"Pey-Shi"""" considered them members of the """"Yüe-Chi"""", who were Indo-European Tocharians. We can't just assume certain origins because of some royal titles. Not everyone who used the title """"Khaqan"""" was automatically a Turk or Mongol. The best example for this is the Indo-European title """"Yabghu"""" (probably from Tocharian or Iranian) whi was almost exclusively used by Non-Indo-European Turks. Now, we can assume that - at some point in history - the early Turks were ruled by an Indo-European-speaking elite (probably Tocharian or Iranian Scythian), but this is not enough to call the early Turks a """"mix of Indo-European and Altaic peoples"""" (see Turkic peoples).

I have added the necessary qualification.  Regarding the original lead, it was a mess. Amongst other things the original lead had redundancies, it employed terms without first defining them or linking to a definition, sometimes the term """"compound"""" was used and other times """"statment"""" was used, the relatively minor matter of material implication vs. logical entailment was too long, used an awful example and just confused what preceded it.  In the lead it would have been sufficient to just say something like: """"The material conditional is to be distinguished from logical entailment (which is usually symbolosed using [double turnstile].""""  The distinction can then be detailed in the body of the article.  Also the failure to even mention propositional calculus  which is the context in which someone is most likely to look up the meaning of the operator  was an unacceptable omission.  By the time someone reaches the study of paraconsistent logical systems they will likely have no need to look up what a material conditional is on Wikipedia.

In fact, rather than wait, here's my complaint:

To whom it may concern, 
 
Hi.  My name's Jim Heller and I'm currently and for some time now caught up in a series of edit wars with Jossi Fresco.  The background is this.  I am a former follower of Prem Rawat, a/k/a Maharaji, a person I believe is a nefarious cult leader.  Fresco, on the other hand, is a current follower and, needless to say, of a different mind altogether.
 
For some years now, ever since the advent of the internet, Rawat and his followers have engaged in a long-standing campaign to whitewash Rawat's past and somehow protect him from the harsh light of history.  The latest flashpoint arose just today when I tried to edit a Wikipedia article of another of Rawat's current followers, a religious studies professor in fact, Ron Geaves (who, by the way, just shot to flashpan infamy as the English academic who opined that the July 7th bombers were """"demonstrators"""", not """"terrorists"""".  
 
Please excuse the fact that, to explain the problem in any meaningful way, I have to flesh out the context somewhat.  My edit concerned an academic (not Wikipedia) article Geaves had written where, discussing a program Rawat held in 1973, he wrote that:
In November 1973, Divine Light Mission had booked the Houston Astrodome, a large sports stadium with a capacity of 90,000.  The event had taken on millenial expectations in the U.S.  with devotees announcing and advertising Maharaji's appearance at the stadium as a second-coming, complete with angelic and alien visitors.  Only 20,000 attended the event and Maharaji did not appear to have any knowledge of his American followers' expectations.  He spoke as he usually does at such gatherings with no hint of messianic promises.

(My emphasis here and below)

In fact, a widely-disseminated invitation to that same 1973 program, Maharaji himself not only demonstrated knowledge of the """"millenial expectations"""" but fanned the flames substantially.  Thus, he declared the program the """"most Holy and significant event in human history"""" and even hinted that it might have intergalactic significance:

A LETTER FROM GURU MAHARAJ JI 

Bonn, Germany 

September 31, 1973 

Dear premies, 

First of all, I would like to tell you about something of great importance to all of us. Because we have realized this beautiful Knowledge which is of great bliss to us all, it is our duty to propagate it to the human race. For it is something they really need. 

In the world there is suffering, hatred and dissatisfaction. That fact does not need proof. It is understood by all that the world is passing through a great moment. No one has satisfaction of mind nor can they find the solution to this. The world is looking for the Perfect Master to come and reveal the Perfect Knowledge of God. There is a supreme energy constantly vibrating in everything making it survive and all the Perfect Masters coem to reveal this Knowledge to people. We can attain all materialistic things and still not have peace, for peace lies inside not outside in materialism. 

As you all know Millenium '73 is being prepared for now. This festival has been organized by Divine Light Mission each year since 1967, in the memory of the late Satgurudev Shri Hans Ji Maharaji on His birthday. This year the most Holy and significant event in human history will take place in America. 

I think that Millenium '73 is a point where we can really get together and enjoy the bliss bliss with all of our borthers and sisters who are premies; and also tell the world that we have received and realized the permanent service of Truth, Consciousness and Bliss which all the world is looking for in one way or manner. 

To do this I really need your help. I really need the help of all the premies in all respects; physically, financially and all other ways to make Millenium '73 come off. This is a festival not for you or me. It is for the whole world and maybe the whole universe. 

I hereby invite you to this Divine Festival of Peace, Millenium '73 and request all premies to help me financially, physically and spiritually to make the program manifest for all seekers of Truth. 

Isn't it about time you all get together and help me bring peace to this Earth? 

Blessings to you all, 

[Sant Ji Maharaj] 

 
It is clear, when you contrast Geaves' claim with the documentary evidence, that Geaves, bless his heart, is playing the role of the typical cult apologist, lying about his leader and blaming the followers, the press, anyone at all, for the inexcusable, laughable excesses of the cult.  What's particularly worrying about Geaves, I'm sure you can appreciate, is that, as a religious studies professor, he's imbued with a certain authority that",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

I'm following up on Cannibaloki's review. I completed an entire copy-edit of the article, but I'm going to have to fail this, mainly because it doesn't cover enough material. The """"Bostaph's departure"""" section does not belong in this article, as, while it does mention the DVD, his leave from the band has nothing to do with it. With that gone, I would recommend you look at other example concert video GAs, such as Number Ones (video) and Celebration: The Video Collection, as well as WP:ALBUM#Article body for some ideas. Also, use a bit less quotations, as it disrupts the flow when reading. This is really close to passing in my book, however, so don't give this up! EricLeb01 ( | Talk) """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

The society has had many a notable event prescribed to its name. For example, a student whom is now a astronaut with NASA was once a humble member - Andy Thomas that is. Several other events throughout time, such as the hanging of a car on the torrents footbridge, the disassembly and reassembly of a entire vehicle into a corridor of the third level of engineering south, the stealing and ransom of Ronald McDonald from the myer center - all were orchestrated by AUES members. The way I have explained them here makes such events seem only of interest to a quite narrow, local, audience, but when thought about, they are things which can be told in such a way that they are of interest to the greater population. Things such as the hot water system in the Crown and Anchor pub, in the city, being removed by students during one of the engie pub crawls would also be notable, in my opinion.

JP, thank you for finally explaining what your problem is. Of course what Jackson said is relevant. This is an article on Jesse Jackson. If Jackson puts his foot in his mouth, it is relevant. A cited statement does not violate NPOV. I learned that fact the hard way when I tried to edit cited statements out of the article on Michael Savage. As far as whether or not Jackson contradicted himself, are you denying that Jackson used to be for interracial marriage? Do you want me to cite a source saying that he used to be for interracial marriage? Liberals like Jackson have always referred to conservative whites from the south who opposed interracial marriage as """"racists."""" Evidently, it's """"in"""" for a minority to be against interracial marriage, though. Or maybe it's that white men can't have black women, but black men can have white women with Jesse. It's pretty obvious to me that if Jackson is now saying that it's """"illegal"""" for a white man to fantasize about a black woman (What the hell does he mean by this? It's perfectly legal to fantasize. What an idiot!), then he is obviously against white men dating black women. He wants """"whitey"""" to keep his hands off black """"property."""" Perhaps Jackson needs a translator, since he frequently says things that make no sense. Do you know what Jackson meant? I honestly don't see any violation. Please elaborate further, and we can work out a compromise. However, I will get the statement in the article. Liberals who hate Michael Savage have a bunch of negative quotes about him in his article, so I think that it's fair for a conservative like me to get in negative quotes about Mr. Jackson, as long as the quotes are cited by a reputable source.

 Shrug. You can say that for any kingdom. The Germanic concept of a """"kingdom"""" is not a geographic area, it is a political area, defined by folks, not acres.  The area (often a Latin term) will always be an informal shorthand for a collection of dominions of barons owing allegiance to a king. """"East Franks"""" are a folk, """"Germany"""" is an area. """"Lombards"""" are a folk. """"Italy"""" is an area, etc. The """"Kingdom of Germany"""" refers to the collection of barons in the area that once constituted the lands of the East Franks and their subject tribes (Swabians, Bavarians, Saxons, Thuringians, etc.), which by the 10th-11th C. is now settled down into large duchies (the royal duchy of Franconia, plus Swabia, Bavaria, Saxony, etc.).  This specific collection of barons acclaim their king, who is crowned in Aachen (usually) by the Archbishop of Mainz (almost always).  This is the """"King of Germany"""", and the area these barons cover we can call the """"Kingdom of Germany"""".  There really is no term more convenient to call him or it.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

4afdc8e174fa2389,"""Subsequently Eleland came along and deleted most of your modifications claiming that they were not from authoritative enough sources and that they were disproportionate within the article. Eleland made a unilateral decision about all this and was quite perturbed when I reinstated the article. Eleland proceeded to get into a deletion war, would not entertain discussion prior to making wholesale deletions, and then contacted administration to have the sections struck out. Please check discussion for Admin's response. I do not question anything said by Manning, however it does not appear that he has looked at the sources as thoroughly as Fluri. Also Eleland placed warnings on the article regarding the veracity of the citations.

Admittedly, I have responded vigorously in discussion, but only to protect the material that had already been checked by Fluri. Anyway it appears that Eleland is on a messianic crusade to have it struck off the record. This is somewhat surprising given Eleland's herculean efforts to include material about Israel on the Caterpillar.Inc issue. Clearly Eleland is not the impartial arbiter that he would have us believe under """"Ed O'Loughlin"""" but a bit of an anti-Israel activist himself.

This is perhaps strange considering, and I quote Eleland in the discussion on Caterpillar Inc.: Editors must not remove information about an argument because they personally disagree with the argument. Wikipedia must include all notable points of view which appear in verifiable published sources. Reporting that activists have said something does not imply that the activists are correct. Removing those reports because you think the activists aren't correct contradicts Wikipedia's core policies. Eleland

 Sushi red snapper. 

I'm trying to figure out how to handle various fishes known as red snapper and mostly wanted to leave this link here for myself for future reference. There's a real mess with the species used in sushi; Japanese snapper claims that species is used, while Pagrus major says it is the species the Japanese common name """"madai"""" is applied to. Meanwhile, izumidai redirects to northern red snapper, but is apparently a term for sushi-grade tilapia which is what most often appears as """"red snapper"""" in Japanese restaurants in the US. 

The broader issue is that red snapper refers to many fishes throughout the world. Lutjanus campechanus is the red snapper of the southeastern US, and the only species which the US FDA allows to be marketed as """"red snapper"""" (but enforcement is non-existent). A couple species are known as red snapper on the Pacific Coast of North America, and it appears that snapper is exclusive to a single species in Hawaii and New Zealand. Pretty much anywhere else in the world (Indian Ocean, Caribbean/western Atlantic, western Pacific), """"red snapper"""" is hopelessly ambiguous (though most frequently refers to Lutjanus species)   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

My Offer Anent My Unblock
I am back to pursue my case, not in the form of """"trolling and harassment"""", but in a polite, urbane manner. I ask that you bear with me on this.

History
From alpha to omega, here is an aperçu.
My work on Wikipedia commenced rather abruptly when I made my debut using 207.97.213.170. My subsequent edits were along the same line. I was promptly blocked for vandalism. In retrospect, I understand that my edits were definitely not constructive, but I would not construe them as vandalism, as I was just an abecedarian then. 

I returned with Hiineedrequestforcomment to """"pursue defense of my actions on my previous account"""". I was quite hostile to Jpgordon and continued to argue my case quite impolitely, insulting other users. After making my only constructive edit, I was blocked for """"trolling and harassment"""". I continued to argue against my block, and my block settings were changed, disabling me from editing at all.

I returned with The Reformed Editor, truly thinking I was reformed. I created my userpage declaring that I was the alternate account of Hiineedrequestforcomment. I made several improvements to Julia Mancuso, Shaun White, Ted Ligety, Purna, Akola city, and 2010 Winter Olympics, but then I started arguing with users about the ranking of the 2010 Winter Olympics medal table. I do admit that my actions were quite inappropriate. Après reading my userpage promulgation, Andrwsc blocked me. I asked him tersely, """"Does [my block] mean that all indefinitely-blocked users cannot ever return to Wikipedia to make changes, even if they are helpful?"""" This prompted him to change the block settings of Hiineedrequestforcomment to allow me to make my offer. Here I am now.

Declarations
I pledge allegiance to Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit. However, that promise has unfortunately been denied to me.
I promise to let sleeping dogs lie. It was my obsession with pursuing justice of that petty IP that led to my downfall.
I promise to continue making constructive edits. The following are the inexhaustive diffs for all the constructive edits I have made:
Bode Miller
Julia Mancuso
Shaun White
Ted Ligety
Purna
Akola city
2010 Winter Olympics
And many more. . .
I issue an apology to all those editors who have construed me as a detriment to Wikipedia.

Final Thoughts
The year of 2009 was an annus mirabilis, but my only regret was not coming to Wikipedia earlier.
To Andrwsc: you didn't think much of my constructive edits. Yes, they may not have promoted articles to Featured Article of Good Article statuses, but nonetheless, they were improvements to the general quality of Wikipedia.Also, I don't understand why you are giving me this chance when you say at the Administrators' noticeboard that you """"would personally !vote oppose to an unblock"""". Does that mean I have no chance of getting unblocked?
I will assay to refrain from argufying that may launch into a full-scale argumentum.
I hope to participate in the development of an accurate, just, collegial ambiance here on Wikipedia. For me, in the aftertime, I hope to develop mutual understanding with my fellow editors. My amour propre is quite high now, so please don't ruin it.
I hope you will help me help Wikipedia by unblocking me forthwith and allowing me to apply my abracadabra to those articles stark",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

If nothing comes up, the page will end up merged eventually. Right now, no one has really attempted to clean up the articles, but they are not in really bad shape compared to others. Bella Swan has a nice sized concept/creation section and a large reception section. Edward Cullen (Twilight), though lacking concept/creation and reception notes, has a large Film Portrayal secrtion. Jacob Black really needs work, though. Personally, I'd like people to work on the actual list. It needs reception and concept/creation notes, not to mention referencing from books and dialogue.   

Nah, I don't think so. Stephenie Meyer realistically spends too much time writing about how gorgeous Edward looks (seriously), and even if she had described her characters in more detail, all the character articles would be classified as stubs. There's really no need for so many stubs when we can condense them all into fewer pages.

 Criticism 

Would this be a valid source for criticism? blastmagazine.com

The columnist analyzes the Twilight series and calls into question the books' overall writing issues, story and character development, and controversies in how it presents gender roles and how those could negatively affect the young fanbase. I know the source is a blog, but if the writer (Kellen Rice) had credentials that made her article valid, would it be a good source? I can't seem to find her credentials, though, so any help would be appreciated.   

 Twilight explicitly described as 'porn' 

 

Something to the effect of the frequently surfacing description of Twilight as """"softcore porn"""", """"girl porn"""", and similar should be added to the section on critical reception. 78.34.180.107

Some copyeditors have switched jobs, or are retired, or aren't sufficiently challenged, and wouldn't mind doing a little volunteer copyediting, and it would be nice to have more professionals in the mix.

 NPOV and unbalanced 

I would prefer both tags, but I suppose once is enough.  First a certificate of Life birth is not a birth certificate which the lefties are trying to say as proof he was born in hawaii.  If his mom was a astronaunt and gave give on the moon, he could still have a certificate of live birth.  So the certificate of live birth is worthless as evidence.  His own family says he was born in Kenya, and if so his father was kenya and his mom was 16 and could not pass US citizenship to Obama.  If this claim is true, he cannot be a natural born citizen required by artical 2 section 1 of the us constitution.  Secondly his islamic school in Indonesia required him to be a Indonesian citizen, while it may be possible to get an exception, we don't know.  He has traveled to ?Iran? during the 1980s when it was illegal for Us citizens to travel there, was his travels illegal or did he travel under a different citizenship.  There is no proof that obama is a natural born citizen yet more than enough doubt, and there have been lawsuits over these doubts but the courts are refusing to hear these cases.  We cannot say Obama was born in Hawaii, nor can we say he was Born in Kenya, his birthplace is unknown.  Obama and his team of lawyers, probably on the taxpayers dole, are trying to hide whether or not he is a natural born citizen; smells fishy, what does he have to hide?  As long as we have a constitution, we have to find that out or he is not the president.  Needless to say our brave military have joined a quo warrento lawsuit, and ask by what authority obama has to be president and CEO over them.  It remains an open issue, and so far there is no evidence leading us to his birthplace or his citizenship status, however the bulk of the evidence points in the direction of him being illegal.

  also being censored are obamas ties to socialist and terrorist organizations.  He is affiliated with Ayers, who an uncover FBI agent recorded a dialog where Ayers group planned to kill 25 million americans who could not convert to socialism.  During the 1990 the socialist New Party listed him as a member.  His national security picks have ties to the chinese Government, and to the bin ladin Family.  And he seems cozy to opening up to socialist Cuba as well.  He has a harvard Law degree, his economic stimulus full of financing socialist and Keynesian polcies that will bleed the private sector dry while bankrupting our nation fiscally spending more and more money we don't even have and a debt we cannot repay, some newspapers have argued that obama's """"fix"""" will cause a second depression.  So one might have to argue is a harvard law degree completely worthless, or if Obama plans to lead us down the road to destruction to nationalism and communism.  Not sure how the coffin workers bring paid in coffins will fair when everyone is starving to death, people will need food probably more than giving their loved ones a proper burial-if they don't resort to cannibalism.  If we can learn that he is illegal the constitution would then render all his laws, treaties, and executive orders are illegal and will be reversed and he can be stopped from ruining our great republic; if in deed he is legal then we as a nation are screwed.""",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

 Polyspermy 

Before you revert the stable version - please discuss this first on the talk page. As for your question:
Look at the beginning of the third line. The Talmud quotes the verse from 1 Samuel 17, 4, which goes as follows: """"And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines"""", right? Now, look at your Bible - ibid., and see the full verse: """"And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath..."""". Right?
So, the Talmud quotes the verse about Goliath, and then: interprates this verse - using a pun - in the following way (see the Talmud ibid. in that third line): """"One hundred foreskins of Philistines - got her [i.e. his mother] pregnant"""". In other words: the Talmud explains, that the biblical words """"And there went out a champion"""" - mean:  """"And there was created/born a champion"""", and it also explains that the biblical words: """"out of the camp of the Philistines"""", mean: """"out of a hundred foreskins of Philistines"""". Note that this fantastic interpretaion made by the Talmud - is based on a pun: the word for """"camp"""" is similar to (i.e. sounds like) """"a hundred foreskins"""" (not in English of course). Note also that fantastic interpretaions for the Bible - are very common in the Talmud.
Now, look ibid. at the next line (i.e. the fourth line); The Talmud now explains how - having so many fathers - is really possible from a biological point of view, so the Talmud continues: """"Rav Matania said: no controversy over that; as long as the sperm [of the first man] hasn't gotten rotten [in the woman's body] yet, a woman can get pregnant by two men - all at once"""".
Notice that all of the Talmud's commentators explain all of this - as I did.
Hope this helps. Anyway, next time, please consult pefore you revert the stable version.

Jayant Bhushan was for the intervenor (AAP's) Prashant Bhushan in WP(C) 4821/2010. The case is decided, and the present legally settled position is on the Discom's website (link given earlier) as follows:-
Shri Prashant Bhushan was also party to this and the issue has been conclusively settled by the Hon’ble court, vide its judgment on May 23, 2011.
8. CAG Issue
Response
At present the CAG has no authority to audit the accounts of private companies in view of the clear provisions contained under Article 149 of the Constitution of India.
The various provisions of the CAG Act, 1971, clearly set out the duties and powers of the CAG are with respect to audit of accounts of Union States and Government Companies / Corporations. These powers do not extend to private companies.
Subsequent to transfer of management control to discoms in 2002, CAG categorically confirmed stating that from July 1, 2002, discoms are not government companies under Section 617 of the companies Act, 1956.
DERC itself, in its tariff order of 28.05.09, had observed that the private discoms being a company, incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, presently there is no such provision of CAG audit in respect to private companies.

You say that Technocrats are attempting to push they're political ideas, but if you know anything about Technocracy you will know that it is avowedly A-political or Anti-political, so I don't know where you get that idea from. As for your argument that the article shouldn't talk about Technocracy's ideas and goals, etc. well I find that a bizarre suggestion. I mean, every article on Wiki about a specific group would be expected to have info on the ideas, goals and beliefs of that group. That would be like saying that the article on say, the Republican Party (United States) (or any other group we care to mention), shouldn't have any info on what that group advocates. Obviously it should have as much info as possible, the only thing that matters is that it is presented in an accurate and neutral way.
Eh, you said there existed entries on Technocracy in some encyclopaedias, can I ask which ones? As for using them as sources, I don't think we're actually meant to use one encyclopaedia to write another, as that would be getting the info second or third had, and the other encyclopaedias must have eventually derived their knowledge of Technocracy from the movement itself and it's literature, so I see no reason not to simply present that info first had. Besides, I've not seen any online encyclopaedias that have better information about Technocracy than this article, I believe I've seen brief overviews, but nothing of any great detail (of-course if you know of any articles that have potentially useful info, then go ahead and present it).

Hi, and welcome to Wilipedia!

Trivia is a controversial (as well as unavoidable) matter, especially on opera related articles.   Not knowing The Police, I wonder if their song really refers to an Italian opera with f's in place of ph's.   If so I'll have to keep an ear out!

Er, no. Nice try (I'm being kind) but do you really believe that portraying a £720,000 EU grant for researching new ways of thickening several food products, including yoghurt, as """"£700,000 to stop yoghurt going runny"""" is as much of a misrepresentation as the way you mischaracterised Britain's 1939 declaration of war? No, of course you don't. Frankly, I find it hard to believe that anyone can think of the yoghurt thing (and many other examples) as being any kind of misrepresentation, but the Commission certainly does, else such stories wouldn't be on its many lists of """"myths"""", so I have to assume that you and other Wikipedians are being sincere when you see misrepresentation where I see only (justifiable) disrespect and ingratitude.

So let's start from the bottomthe top. The current article starts with a lot of tosh about urban legendsby stating that """"Euromyths can be either wholly untrue or a deliberate distortion of the facts"""". Truth is unwelcome, as is accidental or ignorant distortion. As far as Wikipedia is concerned, a Euromyth is always a deliberate calumny.

Now, that's certainly the way the word is used by a very large number of people. Trouble is, though, that this very large number of people is ignorant of the facts - the facts as presented by the arch-priests of this very large number of people, to wit the European Commission and its many propaganda outlets. To put it simply, any examination of any official list of Euromyths will throw up at least one Euromyth that is to myth, falsehood and misrepresentation what Plan D was to  democarcy, dialogue and debatenot mythical at all.

So the article is wrong to start as it does. Once you have conceded that, and all this tedious """"urban legend"""" ping-pong has been banished, we can get on with sorting out the rest of it. (I currently see five categories ...)

Thanks so much for asking, . I know I often come off as a douche, and I've been fixing that, mainly by following your example. So just so i'm glasslike: I really am grateful for how you've treated me since November, in this,  my third attempt in 10 years, to withstand our """"battlefield""""-hardened Wikipedian culture. War is seductive. i was twice seduced, then repelled, by our """"war"""" games. This time, I'm here to stay, thanks to good Wikipedians like you. And i'm changing the way i play the game. Instead of rejoining our Competitive games (which only boys, mainly, love), from now on I'll be playing only Cooperative games, which both girls (and some boys), normally,  do enjoy. 

Now back to praising you: You could have simply done to me what too many other powerful Wikipedians do: with 2 clicks, undo the ~1 wo/man-week of work my friends and I invested into the Cooperation Index and 3d2do designs. Side note: we designed those mechanisms specifically for the inactive Community & Kindness projects that we adopted back in November. Our premise is this: systemic bias and other dysfunctions within the Wikipedia Community are but symptoms of diseases which have rendered our Community moribund for almost a decade. But we did agree that the Gender Gap among Wikipedians is the most shameful of these symptoms, so our first application of the Cooperative design is meant to end - and quickly - the gender bias among Wikipedians.

 also expressed some major concerns, in a note to me via the Gender Gap list. 

I've got two unmovable deadlines today in the extra-wiki world (so annoying, that) but I'll be back ASAY to address each of your points, at the Project's Talk page: Wikipedia Talk:WikiProject Countering systemic bias/Gender gap task force/3D2Do

I don't quite understand your suggestion that the article needs to be split into 3 different ones, what would these different articles be? Firstly let's just overview what is already in place, we've got this article: Technocratic movement (and the sub-articles like Technate, etc.), we've got Technocracy (which is just a disambiguation page), Technocracy (bureaucratic) and Technocrat (derogatory). Then we have Network of European Technocrats, which is part of the broader Technocratic movement. So what you're saying is we need a Technocracy Incorporated article, specifically about that group, detached from the main article in the same way as NET? Well, I suppose that could be done, but remember that that article did already once exist and was then merged with this one. What would this article contain if all the Tech Inc. stuff were taken out and put in a different article? I have to say, I think further splitting of the articles will only create an even more confusing array of definitions for readers. Perhaps we should think about reformatting the above articles into a more reasonable arrangement. The article Technocracy used to be a lot bigger and gave more info on the different groups and definitions of the term, but it was recently trimmed down to something very small, (which I was against doing BTW). So to start from the beginning, we have the word Technocracy, which has acquired many different meanings, one meaning being a Bureaucratic oligarchy of Scientists, this is addressed in the Technocracy (bureaucratic) and Technocrat (derogatory) articles and isn't really relevant here. The other meaning, the one we are concerned with here is that used by the Technical Alliance and Tech Inc. and subsequently adopted by several other groups in 1930's. Then NET, which was essentially a direct branching from Tech Inc., just in Europe, but has adopted it's own ideas, some of which are different to Tech Inc's. I don't really know what is the best way to proceed yet, but I don't think anything should be split or deleted without a lot more discussion.",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

My cite states that no notes issued prior to the """"greenbacks"""" were legal tender under the greenbacks and you would have known this if you had bothered to read he material I posted in the two wiki Fed articles. BTW: are you wise and omniscient ones (sarcasm) aware that Federal reserve notes were not legal tender until 1933?

lets see if you read it here 

I believe that Congress does NOT have the power to make paper money a legal tender and does not even have the power to make gold and silver a legal tender.The reference below show clearly that at least one US president and Funding Father agree with me on both counts and that at least two US presidents, and Founding Fathers agree with me on one count.

I hope that claims of original research and synthesis can now be put to rest as BOGUS.

An old NY times article http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res;=9501E2DB133BEE33A25751C1A9669D94679ED7CF references the following quotes

James Madison  - Thus the pretext for a paper currency and particularly for making the bill a legal tender, either for public or private debt, was cut off

Thomas Jefferson - I now deny their (Congress's) power of making paper money, or anything else, a legal tender

A Mr Benton who is also cited, states: The power granted to Congress to coin money is an authority to stamp metallic money, and is not an authority for emitting slips of paper containing promises to pay money.

Per Yale Law School records of the minutes of the vote to TAKE AWAY from Congress the power to """"emit bills of credit"""" during the Constitutional Convention as recorded by Founding Father and future president James Madison  http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_816.asp 

FN23 This vote in the affirmative by Virga. was occasioned by the acquiescence of Mr. Madison who became satisfied that striking out the words would not disable the Govt. from the use of public notes as far as they could be safe & proper; & would only cut off the pretext for a paper currency, [FN24] and particularly for making the bills a tender [FN24] either for public or private debts. 

and

""""Mr. Ghorum was for striking out, without inserting any prohibition. if the words stand they may suggest and lead to the measure.""""

My aside: The power to be struck out was the power to """"emit"""". Mr. Ghorum, (Madison misspelled the name - the person is actually Nathanial Gorham) states that if the words stand (the words being """"emit bills of credit"""") that """"they may suggest and lead to the measure"""" with the measure being printing legal tender paper money. To be ABSOLUTELY clear, this vote denied Congress the power to """"emit"""" per money, and strikes at the core of arguments in favor of paper money, because Congress cannot make paper money a legal tender because the power to print paper money was REMOVED from Congress. If Congress cannot even print paper money, how can it make it legal tender?

In Federalist 44 - Madison states 

The extension of the prohibition to bills of credit must give pleasure to every citizen, in proportion to his love of justice and his knowledge of the true springs of public prosperity. The loss which America has sustained since the peace, from the pestilent effects of paper money on the necessary confidence between man and man, on the necessary confidence in the public councils, on the industry and morals of the people, and on the character of republican government, constitutes an enormous debt against the States chargeable with this unadvised measure, which must long remain unsatisfied; or rather an accumulation of guilt, which can be expiated no otherwise than by a voluntary sacrifice on the altar of justice, of the power which has been the instrument of it.

From Craig v Misouri

 The whole was intended to exclude everything from use as a circulating medium except gold and silver''', and to give to the United States the exclusive control over the coining and valuing of the metallic medium. That the real dollar may represent property, and not the shadow of it.

From the dissenting opinion to one of the Legal Tender cases http://supreme.justia.com/us/79/457/case.html - starts with THE CHIEF JUSTICE, dissenting'Acts of Congress not made in pursuance of the Constitution are not laws.We perceive no connection between the express power to coin money and the inference that the government may, in any contingency, make its securities perform the functions of coined money, as a legal tender in payment of debtsIt is unnecessary to say that we reject wholly the doctrine, advanced for the first time",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

I watch Asian cartoons
I'm a weeaboo

I live in my mom's house
I'm like 32
I collect swords and throwing stars
'Cause I'm a weeaboo

Sticks and stones may break my bones
But I will always be one step ahead of you
Because I read the manga
(You're such a fucking pleb, are you even even Japanese bro?)

I haven't showered in like 16 weeks
All my friends and peers are ashamed of me
'Cause all of a sudden
I think I'm Japanese

[Chorus]
Yes, I'm a weeaboo (x4)
A filthy weeaboo
(Naruto's so overrated)
A dirty weeaboo
(You wanna see my katana collection?)
A fucking weeaboo
(I'm learning Japanese on Rosetta Stone)
A disgusting weeaboo
(So I'm like basically Japanese now)

[Verse 2]
I sit at my computer desk
And argue with teenagers on the internet
About atheism
And how Japan is superior to other countries
I learned a bit of Japanese
So now i'm qualified to be a part of their community
So i made my avatar a kawaii waifu

[Chorus]
Yes, I'm a weeaboo
(Uh duh, everybody wears kimonos)

This is a subject that is still controversial, both as to the area of origin and the routes

different dialects spoken in the Philippines at the time of Portuguese and Spanish entry to
the Philippines in the early 15th century were all of the Austronesian Super Family. That
is where the agreement ends.
In the Philippines, the two best known hypotheses are those of Peter Bellwood and
mine (Solheim). While my hypothesis—which will be the main subject of this
presentation—started developing over 40 years ago, Bellwood’s is more recently
developed and has had much greater acceptance outside of the Philippines. Simply put,
he believes that ProtoAustronesian

and was brought from there to Taiwan by maritime Chinese bringing with them rice
agriculture; this around 7000 years ago.

Lana is clearly feuding with Summer Rae, and everything is setting up for them to wrestle each other in either a singles or mixed tag match (with Ziggler and Rusev).

Stephanie is in the HHH category of saving his bullets for major feuds and angles, as she has wrestled the Bellas (with that feud main eventing Raw a couple of times last year), and has some business with Rhonda Rousey - which was set up last year at WrestleMania, and is rumored to culminate this year at Mania.

This is something relatively new in wrestling, where WWE is using people like Brock, Taker, Rock, Sting, HHH, and Stephanie in spurts for feuds leading up to major shows, then they disappear/fade into the background for awhile, and then they come back for their next feud/match, and so on, and so on.

0fed60b513d1dd8f,"""=== Page is in rough shape ===
With the recent purge of content, the page is not as informative as it once was.  The biggest problem is the first section which had the  """"proposed benefits of basic income"""" topic removed.  One editor may appear to hate naturalfinance.net, since the reason for removal was declaring that site to be a blog.  Also removed were affordability calculations that were researched and verified with working links, but also published on a platform that can be declared to be a blog.  Meanwhile the content left in the top section has poor references that do not appear to match the content.  For instance there is no reference for any conclusive argument or data that basic income creates a disincentive to work, and the link to reciprocity is not online, and the topic not a major issue.  Both of those topics have good quality """"blog classifiable"""" sources available.

In order to Be Bold, I would recommend that eligible source material be broadened to include any quality content, including from sources that are not government funded.  Basic income is after all not within any traditional government agenda, and so limiting information to sources funded by interests against basic income harms the quality of the article, and prejudices/suppresses the article from being informative and enlightening.  Barring this broadened content eligibility, we all need guidance for what is eligible content, and perhaps what makes naturalfinance.net ineligible.  (The content there was written in 2011, and has been adopted, whether independently or without attribution, by other authors)

Here is the major recent deletion https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Basic_income&diff;=595677190&oldid;=595667344 .  Specifically the proposed benefits section should be reproduced.  Some of these can be sourced elsewhere, but we need a clear understanding of why it was originally deleted:   

Proposed Benefits

naturalfinance.net describes several purported benefits of social dividends and basic income:
 Wealth redistribution is the best possible economic development program because the wealthy don't spend as great a portion of their income as the poor do.
 Basic income is the most efficient possible form of wealth redistribution because there is no bureaucratic overhead needed to filter recipients, or find and punish abusers.
 Basic income as an alternative to public retirement pensions (such as social security in the US) is the only possible prevention of generational theft that will occur if the funding sustainability of future retiree pensions and care is threatened
 Reduced crime as a result of lower levels of desperation.
 Balanced power in the labour market as a result of not needing work out of desperation, and better competitive position of workers if some people choose not to work.
 Better work opportunities as a result of people better able to afford an education or business start up.
 Smaller government made possible and attractive by the alternative of increased basic income to offset any program cost reduction.  Viewed this way, the cost of every government program is paid for equally by each citizen, even if the source of government revenue is progressive income taxation.
 Social justice is achieved efficiently and automatically, with less requirement on charity and welfare.
 It is easier for volunteer home owners to help the poor and secluded through group homes by being able to rely on their certain income.  Its possible and easier for the disadvantaged to group up and help themselves in the same manner.
 Natural finance's definition of social dividends (variable basic income: tax revenue surplus over social program expenses) essentially allows the level of basic income paid to citizens to rise with economic, productivity, and automation growth. The affordability of basic income adjusts automatically to the performance of the economy.

Dougweller, Okay, I can see that you're not going to respect my wish. The """"attacking"""" was done by SamEV. (Whether you're ever going to admit it or not.) As mentioned above, he claimed that the Italian unification gave Italy a king, not a president. I proved to him that the unification gave Italy both. He further claimed that Spain ruled Naples, Sicily and Sardinia during Columbus's time, and he sent me about five Wikipedia articles that he said would prove it. (And called me ignorant!) I did not care to look at his articles, as he might have changed them deliberately for his own self-serving needs. So, instead, I went to Wikipedia's """"Italian Renaissance"""" article, and I found it stated that during the Middle Ages (1300-1499), Naples, Sicily and Sadinia were ruled by the Arabs and the Normans. This seemed more on the right track to me. On Monday, I borrowed a book about the Italian Rennaisance from my local library. In truth, Naples, Sicily and Sardinia were governed mostly by the Arabs and the Normans during this time. Spain was involed in it with the Normans. The Norman kings and queens were marrying Spanish kings and queens, in these parts of Italy, and future rulers included second and third generation nobles who were born on the Italian peninsula. All said, Spain had a bit to do with these parts of Italy at that time. It's generally accepted that the lion's share of it all belongs to the Arabs and the Normans. SamEV's gross exaggeration about Spain ruling these areas, at that time, is a sad reminder that people who edit on Wikipedia are not always using the exact truth. Now, regarding SamEV's attacks. I was raised, in what I believe, is the correct way. The majority of people agree, that calling someone """"ignorant"""" is offensive and insulting. (Dictionaries often point this out.) Unfortunately, there exists a minority of people, who, with mean-spirited intention, will call people such names, and, then, hide behind a false angelic face of well-meant wisdom. I don't buy this type of mentality! SamEV, says above that """"it's no crime to be ignorant"""". Well, he, himself, was ignorant when it came to some Italian matters on this website.

 Background section 

At the present time, the """"background"""" section cites unspecified interviews with the media, according to which, Ahmed claimed to """"take apart a clock and rebuild it inside a pencil case.""""

The sentence is taken verbatim from the NPR article. However, it links to a Dallas News article, which says no such thing, to a Dallas News interview, which also does not contain this statement, and mentions a WFAA interview, which I've been unable to find. I've checked four different interviews with Ahmed and he does not explicitly describe it as a rebuilt clock in any of them.

If such an interview exists and the statement was not an interpolation by NPR, it would be nice to have a direct link, a quote and a date.

The problem with the statement is that it provides inadequate background for the rest of the article. When the story broke on 9/15, the device was consistently described by the media as """"a homemade clock"""" or """"an invention"""".  The fact that it was a reassembled commercial clock was mentioned in passing by a WFAA article (which quoted Irving police) on 9/16 but otherwise mostly ignored. It only went """"viral"""", so to speak, when Dawkins waded into the controversy on 9/20 and his comments got picked up by the conservative media.

Much of the immediate reaction, from Obama's tweet and Zuckerberg's invitation to Dawkins' lashing out, seems inexplicable if the device in question was acknowledged to be a rebuilt commercial clock from day 1, but makes sense if the device was initially assumed by everyone to be a genuine homemade clock.

That helped a lot, thanks. The thing is most of the media sources in India(often considered the criteria for WP:RS) neither present an event in its complete terms nor is there a neutral perspective ever if any. A lot of issues and persons have been badly attacked by almost every section of the mainstream media, and it is so extremely rare to hit upon a site that gives some fair perspective or the other side of the coin but then they are not generally regarded in front of what the usual sources like The Hindu or the TOI which omits to cover certain parts of India and most of what is published is highly opinionated. The other day, content based on a fairly reasonable source was removed and this was hugely absurd since none of other mainstream media even covered the 2011 Tamil Nadu elections at a length, except for announcing the winning coalition.  Nothing much(in fact nothing at all) is mentioned of this person and his campaigning that brought about the fall of the ruling alliance. At the moment, various Youtube channels and small-scale news agencies(that probably don't even own a website of their own) are the only bearers of pieces of information and its bloody unbelievable that I'am the first wikipedian trying to get all these into Wikipedia. Excluding this personality, There are several others more who are making significant popular impact, but are nowhere to be found in Wikipedia. Its more pitiful that the already experienced and active Indian Wikipedians are not giving a damn either. It only brings editors like me to the suspicion that the existing chaps are perhaps too opinionated and biased to ignore true and essential information coming out, and worse still they are the first to sponsor/support opposition towards others who try to step in for the sake by bringing WP:RS every time. Thousands of other articles meanwhile, present heck loads of falsehood and bulls*it.

However for anyone else: coatracking environmental concerns with one company into another companies article is non-neutral editing. Dow and Dupont are not merged yet. Info on past DuPont environmental concerns may be relevant on a combined Dow-Dupont article once the companies merge - I assume at that point someone will either create a new article on the new company, or attempt to merge the Dow-Dupont articles together.

Assuming this article is kept as a historical article of Dow prior to the merge, it wouldnt be valid here, would be at DuPont, and would be at an article after the merger.

RE Bhopal: The only reason Dow is even relevant is that activists are claiming Dow is responsible for the cleanup once it acquired Carbide many years later.

 Referencing 

Referencing on Wikipedia, thanks to its primitive interface, is a pain. There are a couple of ways to do it: one widely-used method is to simply copy and edit references from another article. The Meridian Hill Park article has a start on references: it's got a heading and a {{reflist}} template, so you're partways there already. There are some extant citations in the text, like{{citation |title=Roads to Diversity: Adams Morgan Heritage Trail |url=http://www.culturaltourismdc.org/sites/default/files/pdf/AMHT_English.pdf |author=Cultural Tourism DC |date=2005}} and {{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?node=cityguide/profile&id;=799601 |title=Meridian Hill Park: Sports and Recreation Locations in Washington, DC on washingtonpost.com's City Guide |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-16}}. You can see that the references are framed by  (or ) and  in HTML-like markup. You use named references if you are going to use a particular reference more than once. When embedded in the text they'll cause notes to appear in the References section at the bottom of the page.

In the top left of the edit window you should see a toolbar that has, at the left, a button that says """"Cite."""" Clicking it will show a drop-down menu of citation references for web, news, book and journal references, which then leads to a form that you can fill out (not all forms need to be used), and will insert a formatted reference wherever your cursor happens to be in the text. Often, for book references, you can dispense with extensive context after the first reference, and just say Smith, p. 15 and go on.

My main concern on the tone of the article is the use of intensifiers and adjectives in general, which is frowned upon in encyclopedic style. A certain dryness is called for, but there's an art to keeping just this side of plodding declarative prose. It's an interesting exercise. Perhaps not Joe Friday, more like Bill Gannon. 

Have a look at the citations policy for more: also verifiability and reliable sourcing are important. The policies on no original research is important, since Wikipedia is a tertiary source that relies on secondary published sources.

 Sich riflemen/Urainian Sich Riflemen/Ukranian socutss 

Hi Chris

I am responding to ensure clarification in this matter

""""Ukrainian Sich riflemen"""" (1914-1920)refers to a unit of the Hungarian army
""""Sich riflemen"""" (1917-1919)refers to events when some of the the unit went to Kyiv and started a different group by absorbing local fighters and the youth organisation

As you can see these are military units, or at least para military, and so are not really related to the scouting movement, more related to the military term scout - someone who knows a lot about the local area and is used for forwards observation. These scout units established in Europe during the first part of the 20th century were not really akin to the modern day scout units. They were paramilitary units designed for living off the land and defending the homeland during times of war or invasion.
It may be that you are wishing to start a """"Ukranian Scouts page"""" to support the modern day scouting movement since the fall of the USSR, there is not one so if that was your wish I am sure that would be OK

I am intending to remove the """"suggested merge"""" tags, and may I suggest that the scout project discuss removing their tags from the pages to avoid confusion for now ?

 747 Table 

Hi how are you?
On the table I created at Boeing 747, I intentionaly left the first 2 years before deliveries at zero to give a clear picture of when the fisrt plane was delivered to a customer. Had I started with 1969, it might make it seem like some deliveries might have been missed. But I started with 1967 and 1968 at zero to show a marked begining of 747s in service. If you dont mind I like to put it back to Zero.  
 I'm good.  Sure, change that back.  That makes sense.  It looked like maybe the deliveries started 2 years behind schedule. - 
 Went ahead and changed the 1967 number back to 0. - 

 777-300ER 

thanks! 

People always make this range mistake. Another guy asked me why a 777F has more fuel than 777-200ER yet has 5,000 km less range? It took a while for him to get it.
 Sure.  If you can improve the wording there more, please do so. - 

 787 

How is it going?
On Boeing 787 there are 8 different aircrafts in the specs. I believe we should remove all of them. Have a nice 3 table specification chart on the 787-3 787-8 787-9 and thats it. We can even bring the 3-way cross section of the 787 right next to this spec chart. I believe articles need to be stand alone and comparing it to everything diminishes this. Why not add Ilyushin il-96 here too then? Or many other aircaft. The 787 article is very very poorly done. Its not an encyclopedic entry. Its simply a collection of newsbits. It has become a forum to bash the A350 or even the A380. As soon as a story comes out, somebody writes a paragraph there. I have been doing some updates and I want to know if you agree about making the article more about the 787 and less about other planes.  
 Hey, going OK here.  I can see both sides on the comparison chart.  2 planes (one smaller and one larger) for comparson is enough.  It'd be OK to remove non-787 planes since other airliner articles don't have them.  The fact this is a new plane helps causes lower quality in the article, I think.  People spend more time just adding info than cleaning it up and all.  I'll keep an eye on it and do what I can.  Take it easy Bangabalunga.  - 

 747-8 Speed 

You are correct!
It was .85 and .845 on Boeing last week. I dont know when they changed it.
I know that wind tunnel testing has not gone well and the 747-8 will have more drag than 747-400 but I guess in order
to have bragging rights against the A380, they must be faster.
I am sure airlines will still cruise at 0.845 though in the Intercontinental just to be efficient.
Take care  
 No problem.  The 747 has had a cruise speed of Mach 0.85 for some time.  Don't think there's not that much a difference there.  Good catch on the upper deck 3/10 windows thing.  I was confused before.  -

Inlet geometry
On F/A-18 Hornet, you added the F-16 as having variable inlet geometry. I always understood that it was fixed on the F-16, and I can have several printed sources on that. Has that been changed on later F-16s? -

The F-4 is from an earlier era.  Please correct that if needed.  Thanks. -

Current Squad
I propose redoing the current squad list a bit (for all South African teams). During the first half of the year, the top players will play Super Rugby for the Bulls; during the second half, some of them will play for the Springboks. I suggest we list all players in this section that are contracted to the Blue Bulls, but also indicate if they play at national team level, at Super Rugby level, at Currie Cup level or at Vodacom Cup level only.

With the current format, I think the only way possible would be to have some kind of indicator. Something like:

Props
  Dean Greyling (NT)
  Rayno Gerber (SR)
  Rossouw de Klerk (CC)
  Basil Short (VC)

Hooker
  Chiliboy Ralepelle (NT)
(NT) Represented South Africa in 2012(SR) Represented the  in Super Rugby in 2012(CC) Represented the Blue Bulls in Currie Cup rugby in 2012(VC) Represented the Blue Bulls in Vodacom Cup rugby in 2012

The indicator would show the highest level the player played at during the season and players would be sorted by position first, then this indicator, then surname.

However, an alternate representation could be:

 PropsNameNTSRCCVC  Dean Greyling                          Rayno Gerber                                      Rossouw de Klerk                                  Basil Short                                                 Hookers  Chiliboy Ralepelle                   

(NT) Represented South Africa in 2012(SR) Represented the  in Super Rugby in 2012(CC) Represented the Blue Bulls in Currie Cup rugby in 2012(VC) Represented the Blue Bulls in Vodacom Cup rugby in 2012

This could again be sorted by playing position, then level played, then surname.  Footnotes can be used if a player represented a different Super Rugby franchise than the main one affiliated with the union, etc. A template (which is a slight variation on {{rugby squad player}}) can be developed to simplify this.

However, Starcade, I think the most productive thing you can do right now is tasking yourself with finding a reliable source that back up the edits you're trying to make.  We have a policy, which can be seen at WP:BURDEN, that says The burden of evidence lies with the editor who adds or restores material. You may remove any material lacking a reliable source that directly supports it. Wikipedia requires that things be proven with reliable sources. If you can find a reliable source that backs up your information, that will solve all of this and would most likely allow the inclusion of the information in the article.  I think that should be your top priority regarding the article.  Thank you. - Ghost 

Second half, Sudoghost:  I had done so beforehand.  I guess I should back up and explain the whole thing.

The dispute is about the scheduling of matches on Wrestlemania XXVIII.  The original list had one match, The Rock vs. John Cena, which was agreed to in a promo the Monday after Wrestlemania XXVII, the first time such a thing had been done that far in advance.

Fast forward to July 17, 2011, where Daniel Bryan, largely seen as a too-small wrestler with no personality in a federation trying to distance itself from """"wrestling"""", won the Smackdown Money in the Bank Ladder Match.  This won him, in storyline, the unilateral right to a WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at any point over the next year.  Last Friday (aired  it actually was taped on Tuesday), he announced that he would cash in that title opportunity at Wrestlemania XXVIII.  http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2011-07-22/results was the source I used.  WWE also has an interview up with Bryan now which was not up when I made the edit.

My issue is that, since the Money in the Bank winner can choose to cash his briefcase any time, he had chosen to do so at Mania XXVIII  and at that moment, became a scheduled match for WrestleMania XXVIII.  Ruth is using the Mr. Kennedy situation to claim that match probably will not take place (Kennedy (now Mr. Anderson, a previous MitB winner, wanted to do the same thing (cash at Wrestlemania), but was quickly unseated by Edge, cancelling that match).  The problem with this is two-fold:  One, it presumes (WP:Crystal, again!) that Bryan will, because he is not seen favorably by Vince McMahon (nor by many WWE marks), lose not only his briefcase but his real-life place on the WWE roster by Mania XXVIII.  Two, if me putting that match up is WP:Crystal, then so, at this early date, is Rock-Cena.  Ruth claims she has WWE travel packages which have already advertised Rock-Cena for Mania XXVIII, but has consistently refused to reference them.  She claims exactly what JaC stated above as sufficient to not only keep Rock-Cena, but remove Bryan from the card AND silence me from saying otherwise!

So I went to the WP:Crystal page and applied the relevant clause. Individual scheduled or expected future events should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place. Dates are not definite until the event actually takes place. If preparation for the event is not already in progress, speculation about it must be well documented.  The event, by the WWE Universe, is notable (it's a Smackdown main event for the largest card of the year for the company), is at least as certain to take place (at the moment) as Rock-Cena (and if that fact changes, we can change the Mania XXVIII page when it does), and the documentation is on WWE's own website, which I provided you.

I believe Ruth is a typical WWE mark, like this other *mumblemumblemumble* up here, and believes that Daniel Bryan is not worthy of even a WWE contract.  I believe her stand is prejudicial, selective, and wrong.  Good faith went out the door about 15 posts ago.  And I do NOT believe in consensus if the consensus is demonstratably wrong!

 Clarification needed - Run in with Tom Pettigrew after shooting her brother 

According to the Wiki article, under """"Brother's shooting"""": """"...later pointing the weapon at a moving vehicle on the adjacent road, trying to get into the vehicle....""""

Does the above have anything to do with this?  It doesn't seem so to me.  Here's a snippet of the article:

Carrying a shotgun by her side, a 21-year-old Bishop walked intently across a car lot into the adjacent storefront, where she began searching for car keys. Coming down from the second floor, she was heading toward the garage when she ran into Tom Pettigrew and a friend, who had spotted her in the parking lot and came to investigate.  """"Her gun hit me in the chest,"""" Pettigrew, 45, recalled from his Quincy apartment. """"I yelled, 'What are you doing?' and she screamed at me to put my hands up. So I put my hands up.""""

But the Braintree police chief has cast doubt on that conclusion [that she accidentally killed her brother], and the armed confrontation at the garage provides new insight into her state of mind after her brother's death. The Boston Herald first reported Pettigrew's account of the events today.  Only minutes after that shooting, according to Pettigrew, Bishop frantically told workers at the garage she had been in an argument with her husband and needed a car to escape, nervously scanning the premises as she kept the gun pointed at their backs.

So, my question is did this Pettigrew incident happen before or after she pointed the weapon at a moving vehicle?  In other words, what's the time line?  Thanks.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Article needs review by nuclear physicist(s)
Just skimming the introduction I found three rather significant factual errors which I corrected.  I review those here.

The first point was that the article insisted that fusion occurs between like-charged atomic nuclei, but this limitation is not true.  For example, a nuclear reaction of 12C+16O can proceed through the fusion channel, yet their atomic charge differs.  There are literally hundreds of such cases, and citation would be gregarious and seems unnecessary (but I can link a few articles if anyone disputes this point).

The article suggested that two protons can fuse, and even suggested that such a reaction is governed by the nuclear strong force.  Not true.  p+p->d is a weak interaction, because you must convert a proton into a neutron.  Weak interactions are not fusion.

This error leads to a more general point.  Simply putting nuclei together to make something heavier does not constitute fusion.  A common misconception is that nuclear fusion refers to any coalescence of nuclei, but in nuclear physics, fusion is a specific reaction mechanism.  I will need to confirm, but I believe that, for example, the reactions in the CNO cycles proceed mainly through radiative capture, which isn't fusion.  I can find comments in the introduction instructing me not to correct the """"general"""" statement about nucleosynthesis, but the point is that this is generalized so much that it is incorrect.  I can even find comments there saying not to link to the s-process, but the s-process does not involve fusion reactions as far as I know.  There are actually a rather limited number of stellar nucleosynthesis cases that actually proceed through the fusion mechanism, such as carbon burning and oxygen burning.  These are literally the only two examples I can think of off hand that I'm sure proceed via fusion.  All the rest I'm fairly dubious about at the moment, although some of the pp-chain reactions may also be fusion.

Thus, we in fact need likely a whole section explaining the nuclear physics of fusion and what it is and what it is not.

Finally, I noticed that the article suggested humans have never controlled fusion.  This is naff.  There are plenty of nuclear physics experiments which have not only controlled fusion, but made very careful measurements of the properties of the fusion mechanism at many energy scales.  Clearly, the writer wanted to imply that fusion as a source of stable source of energy has never been achieved by humans, so this was changed to reflect that point.

But given that I could find a serious physics error in every paragraph I read so far, clearly this article needs some serious attention Please do not revert my corrections without discussing the matter here or explicit citation indicating that I am incorrect.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Summary of Scylla
Scylla is supposed to be a beautiful nymph. A man called Glaucus fell in love with her. She didn’t like him and so ran away from him, effectively rejecting her. Therefore Glaucus went to a sorceress, Circe and asked for Scylla’s heart to be softened. Circe however fell in love with Glaucus who rejected her. Circe was angry at Scylla, not Glaucus and so, when Scylla was about to bathe, she poured a powerful poison into Scylla’s pool and so when Scylla bathed she turned into a horrible monster with twelve feet and six heads, all with 3 rows of teeth. Wolf heads grew from her waist and she just stood there, each one of her heads taking someone who passed her. She hated everything which came within reach and killed it.
What makes it a Good Story?
The story of the transformation of Scylla is a good story as it seems to make people realise their emotions when they hear about how Scylla was turned into an eternal being of pure evil even though she did nothing to anyone. She didn’t accept Glaucus’s love and so was turned into a supernatural being because of someone else’s jealousy of her looks.

3 Latin Words to Describe Scylla
Malus-evil
Miser- wretched/sad
Aliquid miri- something extraordinary

The Insight that the Myth Affords Into The Ancient World
This myth does not show us a lot about the ancient world as it is a myth and so does not show a representation of the real world then. It does show us however that Ovid believed strongly in superstition or that he was just an imaginative writer which is equally likely. We can get a glimpse of the colourful words which he uses to describe the dreadful transformation of Scylla.

Other
In a late Greek myth,Recorded in Eustathius' commentary on Homer and John Tzetzes, Ad Lycophron. it was said that Heracles encountered Scylla during a journey to Sicily and slew her. Her father, the sea-god Phorcys, then applied flaming torches to her body and restored her to life.  

According to John TzetzesTzetzes, Ad Lycophron 45. and Servius' commentary on the AeneidServius on Aeneid iii. 420. Scylla was a beautiful naiad who was claimed by Poseidon, but Amphitrite turned her into a monster. 

It is said that by the time Aeneas' fleet came through the strait after the fall of Troy, Scylla had been changed into a dangerous rock outcropping which still stands there to this day.

The character of Sin from John Milton's Paradise Lost is similar to Scylla. Scylla and Charybdis are actually mentioned at one point in the poem.

If Abtract and Sesshomaru want to work informally to Abtracts formula (and Collectonian notes Abtracts areas of interests), then it simply means they don't report each other.

 Help with CSS Reference Manual article 

Dear editor, this morning, I found a new article (CSS Reference Manual) initiated by another author (that I am not acquainted to). However, while the article was at that point (and this moment as well) clearly still 'work in progress', another editor/commenter  had put an 'AfD' on it. Because I feel a strong need for this new article to exist, I defended it strongly with valid arguments, even stating that I wanted to contribute to it myself. However, at the point where on-topic discussions based on argumentation seized to exist, the editor/commenter  started to attack me personally, by openly questioning my personal credibility.
At his talk-page, an earlier ban (half way of the page) is present based on personal attacks (although I am not fully sure that he was the one given the ban or that he was the one that gave the ban to someone else).

Nevertheless: because of this AfD, the article gets flamed now by other users that don't take a closer look at it, for no valid reason, just because it's currently labeled as 'AfD'...

My question is therefore: could you help me out to let this article be enhanced properly to Wikipedia standards?
Because I strongly feel that there is a need for it, it deserves a decent chance, because I would not liketo see very hard work thrown down the drain because of """"a bully"""" that was banned before for personal attacks, and because the article's initial author (again: not me) has done a good job in starting it.""",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

It's a good suggestion. I would go a little further and offer this version of the entire paragraph that circumvents any mentioning of the 'claims':

""""Although the empire had a multi-ethnic character during its history and preserved Romano-Hellenistic traditions, it became known to most of its western and northern contemporaries as the Empire of the Greeks due to the increasing predominance of the Greek element. The use of the term Empire of the Greeks (Latin: Imperium Graecorum) to refer to the Eastern Roman Empire also implied that in the West it was no longer seen as the Roman Empire. The authority of the Byzantine Emperor as successor of Roman Emperors, was challenged by the coronation of Charlemagne as Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III in the year 800. Needing Charlemagne's support in his struggle against his enemies in Rome, Leo used the lack of a male occupant of the throne of the Eastern Roman Empire at the time to claim that it was vacant and that he could therefore crown a new Emperor himself. Whenever the Popes or the rulers of the West made use of the name Roman  to refer to the eastern Roman Emperors, they preferred the term Imperator Romaniæ instead of Imperator Romanorum, a title that Westerners maintained applied only to Charlemagne and his successors.""""

I'd leave the last sentence though since it demonstrates that there was still a certain ambiguity about how Popes and other western rules saw the Byzantine Empire.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

 Middleham and other hoards 

Hi BabelStone, thanks for adding Middleham to the list of hoards. Much appreciated! Also, sorry if I seemed at all caustic in my comment about the addition of the Mesolithic site in Guildford - I only noticed that it might come across bluntly after re-reading! Since you seem to have all the right skills, I wondered whether you might be tempted to work more on the Middleham Hoard article or on other English Civil War hoards with support from York Museums Trust's numismatics curator ? It would be great for our GLAM-wiki partnership to establish direct links between curators and active editors (other than myself!). Particularly ones with specialist knowledge. Any thoughts? Thanks   
Hi Pat, I did have a look at the Middleham Hoard article, but I didn't contribute anything as I thought from your message that some new editors were still working on it ... but as it does not seem to have changed much since then I'll see if there is anything I can do to help.  To be honest, I did feel a little put down by your earlier comment; I rather carelessly pulled the offending term out of the air without giving it sufficient thought, for which I apologize.  I don't pretend to be an archaeologist (a couple of digs and a term at university in the late 1970s hardly count), but I enjoy contributing to archaeological articles precisely because I am not an expert in the field, and editing helps me learn more about subjects that interest me.   
Hi! First of all - Wow! Thanks! The Middleham Hoard article has made great leaps! It is massively appreciated. Secondly: big apologies. I've just gone and re-read my comment about Guildford again and feel very embarrassed - I must have been writing in a massive rush. The irony is that I'm personally very keen on improving the coverage of the Mesolithic on Wikipedia! I appreciate your work on this and other archaeology stuff and hope that we can get past this and work together in the future! Thanks for being magnanimous

 Weeping Frenchman question

This note is to justify a change in a photo caption.
I have added a well-known historic photo to this page, of a Parisian weeping as German troops occupy his city.  Little is known of the origins of this photo, certainly not the identity of the man or why he cries.  It has been widely assumed that he is sorrowful, since he is witnessing foreign troops enter his home, the surrender of his armed forces, and the capitulation of his government.  I had always understood that this was the general sentiment throughout France, and certainly in occupied (non-Vichy) France.
The original caption stated simply that the man weeps.  This was the caption provided by the photo source (www.archives.gov) and the same caption that appears elsewhere in Wikipedia.  The new caption adds """"in joy or sorrow"""".  The addition adds unnecessary ambiguity, and makes a strong implication away from the general consensus on this photo.
I am open to other opinions about this photo, if they can be sourced.  The caption was changed without comment.  I am reverting.  Please discuss if you disagree.""",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Unfortunately, I have a lot of pride and particularly so in my hobbies, one of which is comics.

 New station names - """"Shanghai East"""", """"wuhan South"""", """"Wuhan West"""" - on tielu.org 

I wanted to see how the new train services after the opening of the Shanghai–Nanjing High-Speed Railway show up on www.tielu.org. (I am not endorsing that site, but it just happens to be the one Chinese train schedule site that I am familiar with). As I query """"上海"""" to """"南京"""", the full list of trains shows up, including dozens of the new expensive G trains. The trains that arrive to Shanghai Railway Station are listed as coming to 上海 as expected. But - quite surprisingly - those trains (the majority of the G's) that I believe are going to Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station are shown as arriving to some place called """"上海东"""" (""""Shanghai East"""") instead! So apparently this is how tielu.org chose to call the new Hongqiao Station... Moreover, Wuhan's two """"old"""" stations, the Wuchang Railway Station and the Hankou Railway Station got new monikers as well - 武汉南 (""""Wuhan South"""") and 武汉西 (""""Wuhan West"""") respectively! (See e.g. the schedule for D3010, Wuchang - Shanghai Hongqiao, or, under tielu.org's new dispensation, """"Wuhan West - Shanghai East"""". Now, I have used the tielu.org site long enough, and know that until quite recently Wuchang and Hankou always appeared there under their usual names, none of this """"Wuhan West"""" / """"Wuhan South"""" business.  A quick web search did not find anything particularly useful about this matter, other than a few people's comments on the 武汉南 label for the Wuchang Station on a discussion forum.  If anyone in the know reads this page - could he comment if this """"renaming"""" is simply that website's own idea, or the """"new"""" names have some official or semi-official status? If they are, we probably should indicate so in the appropriate articles.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Perhaps I seem to be repeating myself as you are repeatedly ignoring what I'm writing. The tables are unclear as the order of the product is unclear from them. E.g. the top-right corner of the first table is e6. But does that mean e1 × e7 = e6 or e7 × e1 = e6 ? It would not matter if the product is commutative but as it's not the tables are ambiguous. That is why tables are a very poor way to show the product, and probably why none of the sources use them.
And again please read MOS:LEAD in paticular the section on providing an accessible overview. Or look at the articles already mentioned, Special relativity and Cross product. Or one you are familiar with, Pythagorean theorem. Or a similarly advanced article to this one (and a featured article), Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector.

He graduated top of his Academy class at age 7, had mastered the Sharingan by age 8, became a Chūnin at 10 and was previously a Black Ops (ANBU in the Japanese versions) squad leader at the age of only 13. He left Konoha about five years ago, after killing off his whole clan except for Uchiha Sasuke, his little brother. At 17, he was even feared by Orochimaru. He is now currently associated with Akatsuki. Orochimaru had planed to use Itachi's body as a new container, but seeing as Itachi is powerful to such a degree that even Orochimaru fears him (Possibly for the ability to copy every single jutsu he ever obtained with the sharingan) and has stated that Itachi is stronger, it's easy to see why Orochimaru decided to leave Akatsuki and try his luck with Sasuke instead.

Or,
 There have been many debates between fans whether or not Uchiha Itachi is the most powerful shinobi in Naruto, commonly comparing his power to that of the Legendary Sannin.

 Zambo Article  
Hi Peridon,

I notice you've removed the speedy deletion tag I put on the Zambo Article.  As requested, I have provided sources in the discussion page which I will repeat below for your review and consideration:

African Languages and Ebonics by Dr. Katherine Harris, Central Connecticut State University.  Africa Update. Vol. IV, no. 3 (Summer 1997) Pan-African Language Patterns Revisited:  

""""The erosion of African names also occurred. Samba, meaning comfort in Wolof, is still recalled in musical form in Brazil, where there remains a strong African presence. A possible derivation of Samba is Zambo (Southern/Central Africa), which also means to give comfort. Other derivatives are Sambu in Mandinka and Sambo in Hausa. The fact that the name was at one time fairly common and no longer used may have relationship to a song popularized by white Americans during the war from 1861-1865, """"Sambo's Right To Be Kilt,"""" and especially the derogatory usage of the name enshrined in the book Little Black Sambo.""""

This article must be deleted immediately or a disambiguation tag added to it (as in the Samba Dance article).  I call for the former because the name is African in origin and in African society, it does not mean what this article is purporting it to mean.

Observation duly noted, with this response...

It isn't just that """"elements"""" of French's affidavit is based on other people's stories,  the fact is he swore that """"all facts and statements contained in this affidavit are true and correct.""""  And that included second and third-hand gossip about Kerry's military record in Vietnam.  This guy is  an officer of the court; I find it hard to believe he didn't know what he was doing. 

As to his claim about Kerry lying on MTP in 1971 about his unit being engaged in """"atrocities,"""" let's consider what Kerry actually said:

 SEN. KERRY: There are all kinds of atrocities, and I would have to say that, yes, yes, I committed the same kind of atrocities as thousands of other soldiers have committed in that  I took part in shootings in free fire zones. I conducted harassment and interdiction fire. I used 50 calibre machine guns, which we were granted and ordered to use, which were our only weapon against people. I took part in search and destroy missions, in the burning of villages.  All of this is contrary to the laws of warfare, all of this is contrary to the Geneva Conventions and all of this is ordered as a matter of written established policy by the government of the United States from the top down. And I believe that the men who designed these, the men who designed the free fire zone, the men who ordered us, the men who signed off the air raid strike areas, I think these men, by the letter of the law, the same letter of the law that tried Lieutenant Calley, are war criminals.   

Those sorts of things took place, and were documented as taking place - and in fact were mostly SOP. Even SBVT member William Garlow found  Hoffmann's tactics distasteful . French is not being truthful, or is at best being disingenuous if he simply doesn't think these things should be referred to as """"atrocities,"""" a term that Kerry was quite clear in qualifying. 

And compare French's description of Kerry's """"mutiny"""" remark with what he actually said:

 The fact of the matter is that the members of Coastal Division 11 and Coastal Division 13 when I was in Vietnam were fighting the policy very, very hard, to the point that many of the members were refusing to carry out orders on some of their missions; to the point where the crews started to in fact mutiny, say, """"I would not go back on the rivers again"""" ... 

A little different from claiming that he said """"crews at An Thoi were involved in amutiny,"""" isn't it?  We know for a fact that there was plenty of disgruntlement over SEALORDS policies (read Brinkley, for instance), and officers did refuse to carry out some of Hoffmann's orders .  Is Al French prepared to say no crewmembers ever refused to go back up certain rivers or on particularly foolhardy missions?  We know for a fact the lack of air support was so bad that RF/PF forces  refused to go on patrols without helicopter support.   French is knocking down his own strawman.

I think there's plenty to question in the other affidavits, especially Elliott's and Letson's, but again, I have no problem including them alongside all the other interviews and accountings in the reference section.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

To propose the statement, """"truth is relative,"""" it condraticts itself as identifying that statement as an absolute truth.  """"Truth is relative,"""" is not a relative statement.  It is absolute.  Thus the whole Sophist philosophy is proven incorrect.  Relative truths, however, can exist, but the idea that reality can be percieved in a truth to however a person feels it is, is simple ridiculous.

Personally, I cannot make any sense of the previous paragraph, which just goes to show that individual reality (and therefore truth) is probably relative after all.  In my reality, the truth is that there are rules of grammar and spelling that should be followed if you want people to understand what you are talking about.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

1d5c3381e27f1d3d,"There is no reason to treat AFF and SF the same. The neutrality policy, which explicitly states that it is not to be confused with “all views deserve equal time no matter how many or how few people hold them”, certainly requires nothing of the sort – look it up yourself, I won’t do your homework for you.

 Moreover, the merits of AFF and the merits of SF are two entirely separate and independent things. No amount of slamming AFF – even if your charges are accurate, which I doubt as your behaviour here strongly suggests your perceptions on such things cannot be trusted – can ever, by itself, make SF worth including. SF must stand or fall on its own merits.

There are many serious strikes against including SF, none of which you have even tried to address. First of all it borders on being a blog, which is already an almost-decisive point against it (there was talk of banning links to blogs entirely at one point though it isn’t actually policy to do so as far as I know – certainly “it’s a blog” has stood uncontested as sufficient reason for deleting links on many pages, including the same one we’re fighting over). Equally importantly, having read parts of SF... though I do not myself agree with the characterization, I can see why others have gone so far as to call it a hate site. To be blunt, it's largely the chronicle of one person's persecution complex. As I said elsewhere, it verges on conspiracy theory in the kookiest sense. And then there is the painfully bad prose and screechy hysterical tone most of it is written in – it is simply not in any way a quality site and would not be even if I could credit the actual content. These three points – heck, any two of them – are sufficient reason leave the link off Wikipedia.

And I haven’t even mentioned the most important reason yet. Your site simply is not notable. As far as I can honestly tell, you are the only person on Earth who considers it an important site. If it was worth linking to, someone other than the site's owner would have done so by now, or at least spoken up in favour of such. That last part, at least, is well-documented Wikipedia policy; look it up yourself as I once again refuse to do your homework for you. 

I am sorry – sort of – if some of this comes across as harsh. Though you will no doubt characterize this note as a personal attack, it is not intended as such (and compared to some of the things you’ve posted about others, including me, it’s not even close to qualifying as one). I wish only to lay out as clearly as possible why there is little hope of SF being linked from that or any other Wikipedia page.",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Howdy Zscout370,

A man after my own heart eh, I own that book as well.  The book """"I stand for Canada"""" is an invaluable book indeed.  The book is a very thorough, detailed chronology of the development of the Canadian Maple Leaf Flag.  In my opinion, its the least bias book that comes the cloest to telling the whole story.

However, the book does not tell the whole story.  Would you please consider leaving the link to my French Republican Tricolour form of Canadian Maple Leaf Flag page, on the present Flag of Canada page?

I promise to make no more additions to this Flag of Canada page, whilst we can come to a consensus on my page French Republican Tricolour form of Canadian Maple Leaf Flag.  Does this sound reasonable to you, Zscout370?

The whole presentation last 2 1/2 hours.

 Long reply I'm afraid - hope it's helpful.

 It's possible - no people are flawless. But in fact it very rarely happens. I've been asked to investigate about 6 or so cases this last 9 months, by Irpen, Giano, Bishonen, at RFAR, on ANI, and others, but in most of those - in fact all but one or two in a nine month period, the channel actually functioned exactly as one would wish it to. The one case it didn't, I myself reported in full to the community at ANI, with full summary of the IRC dialog, so that it was made public in detail (a blocked admin had sought an unblock on dubious grounds, another admin had unblocked trusting that without sufficiently checking for themselves). 

 The problem with using """"IRC!"""" as a smokescreen is, those who go there know in fact it's extremely rare, so naturally it loses credibility and is seen as a way to further a """"politicized"""" agenda by those who have bad memories of IRC from years ago. We have an agreed structure to address problems in the channel, yet """"for whatever reason"""" those who feel there is a problem never actually come to me (or any channel operator) to have it resolved. They instead pass logs round, a move guaranteed to shed more heat, but not actually solve the problem. That to me says a lot; a person genuinely with a concern would ask to discuss it, and aim for resolution, just like any other dispute. These cases though are never used for dispute resolution, but only ever for dispute escalation. That seems to say something. 

 As for your specific question, again, yes, it's possible. But unlikely. Administrators, who undergo a quite strict and probing debate over their conduct and understanding of wiki-attitudes, are quite a varied bunch. They include diverse views - Bishonen, Lar, Coren, 1==2, myself, Carcharoth, to name but a few at random in this context. Any and all admins can go to that channel, and some 60 - 70 users on average are regularly there at any given time. They cover extreme diverse views too - to the point that no one stance can get much if any of a toehold there if it isn't proper. There will always be strong voices around. 

 RFA candidates will not be """"representative of the community as a whole"""". The community includes many vandals for example, under-represented at RFA, and many who understand policy well (probably over-represented at RFA). What is possible to say is, the users at #en-admins are probably representative of those users the community has deemed sufficiently trustworthy in judgement and clued in on wiki ethos, to use the tools. This shows in a few ways  for example, an outburst by a user (rare in itself) will often be addressed by general refusal to endorse it, and letting one or two users speak for everyone, or resolving in private chat to actually educate people how to handle things better, and that works very well. On-wiki, you'd get more people inclined to shout than fix. En-admins as a channel tends to look to fix problems by resolving them. When problems are visible, they get addressed. 

 They're also rather long suffering and (I suspect) used to the idea that bad faith will exist no matter what they say or do, and used to having their words pored over in a manner that nobody else would expect on-wiki, and misrepresented if necessary to create smoke. That's not ideal. It's a bit dysfunctional, as it encourages others to stir up problems that have little to no merit, make a large noise over a tiny number of tiny matters (major drama, someone used a bad word once and then when corrected by others agreed it was wrong a few minutes later, for example), to shout rather than approach those who might help, and so on. That kind of foolishness and """"hype"""" helps nobody.

 Lastly, it's worth noting that critically minded users play a very valuable role in that they can approach channel operators if they have concerns, on the spot, or indeed speak up in the channel. When they do, if it's merited, it is usually supported, and would indeed be the best way to effect disapproval or correction. I strongly encourage this, because I greatly suspect the number of cases that would be raised and found genuine would be very small, and they should be raised openly in the channel when noticed. But they probably only happen extremely rarely. To take an extreme case, suppose someone is present, believes an action is wrong, but says nothing, does nothing, and instead complains to a third party (non admin) who lacks all knowledge, but whom they encourage in a belief they have been conspired against. And all the time not broaching it in the channel, nor to any of the channel operators who have made their names known for exactly this purpose last month. This does the community a disservice. Such matters should be named openly to channel users, or privately to channel operators, if they are felt",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Wikipedia:No confidence
Edicts from above are a growing concern for those who believe Wikipedia should be what it purports itself to be in newspapers, magazines, and to new members: a community of editors. As a community, we believe that members who have greater power should use that power to promote consensus and a neutral point of view. When an administrator abuses his or her greater power to promote self interest or personal POV against or without the consent of the community, we believe that member should lose his or her administrative or higher powers. Would you be interested in starting and/or promoting a Wikipedia:No confidence area for the purpose of demoting administrators and above who use their power to push personal POV?

In such an area, any editor could call for a show of support or no-confidence for an administrator or higher. People would sign for either support or no-confidence along with examples of the editor in question creating an edict without consensus, or a statement of why they believe the alleged edicts are in line with community consensus.

 Canadian Association for HIV Research 

The Canadian Association for HIV Research (CAHR) is the professional organization of HIV/AIDS research in Canada or by Canadians.  CAHR includes all researchers and all disciplines of the scientific approaches to HIV and AIDS, for the purpose of its better prevention and treatment and ultimately for its eradication and cure.  Disciplines represented by CAHR include basic science, clinical science, epidemiology/public health and social science.  http://www.cahr-acrv.ca  CAHR reflects their vision, speaks on their behalf and advocates for their interests.  CAHR also works to promote excellence in research and collaboration among researchers.

An estimated 65,000 Canadians were living with HIV infection (including AIDS) in 2008.  http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/aids-sida/research/index-eng.php  Research in the area of HIV/AIDS is critical to combat the epidemic.

 CAHR Mission Promote excellence in HIV research Foster collaboration and cooperation among HIV research communities, including basic science, clinical science, epidemiology & public health, and social science Promote education and the development of new researchers Provide a unified voice for Canadian HIV researchers and engage diverse stakeholders (community, industry, Government, NGO’s etc.) in ongoing dialogue and knowledge exchange to ensure that HIV research remains responsive to their needs. http://www.cahr-acrv.ca/about/vision-mission-history/ 

CAHR works with the Government of Canada to influence public policies that will ensure the optimal benefit to those living with HIV and the optimal return on the governments’ HIV/AIDS investment. CAHR also works with the pharmaceutical industry to ensure that the Canadian environment is ideal to attract industry support for ethically sound and high caliber HIV research.

The organization has a responsibility to people living with HIV and AIDS to ensure that high caliber research is conducted that is meaningful and relevant to their needs. In doing so, CAHR helps to ensure that high caliber studies in all areas of research are being conducted that benefit those living with HIV/AIDS and that help prevent the spread of HIV among those not currently infected.

The CAHR Council is comprised of two groups; the Executive Council and Council Members.
The Executive Council is made up by the President, Past President, President-Elect, Treasurer and Executive Director.
Council Members include the CAHR secretary and representatives from the community, social sciences, basic science, clinical and epidemiology & public health.

CAHR’s principal event is the annual Canadian Conference on HIV/AIDS. This conference is the venue where HIV researchers in Canada present the results of their work and engage in knowledge exchange activities with their peers as well as with investigators in other disciplines and with the HIV/AIDS community. The conference is held each spring and location varies each year. http://www.cahr-conference-acrv.ca/

 Some Wikipedia """"Contributors"""" giving the Dictator Jose Eduardo dos Santos an Engineer Degree in Petroleum 

Some Wikipedia """"Contributors"""" giving the Dictator Jose Eduardo dos Santos an Engineer Degree in Petroleum

This section is taken out from the propaganda web page of the MPLA Peoples Party (Communist Party). Looking at the dates there is no chance that Mr. Jose Eduardo dos Santos could have gone to Russia for a Oil Engineer Degree. Also the MPLA official web page does not mentions any such degree as well. Taking into consideration that this would be considered a major achievement it seems odd to say the least that the MPLA Comrades Totalitarian Party have """"forgotten"""" to mention this intellectual and academic achievement of their murderous and deep ignorant leader.

But in wikipedia from (night to day) """"voila"""" Mr. Jose Eduardo dos Santos (a son of a Sao Tome brick layer) could not have gone to Russia or Timbuktu for a degree, as it was economical impossible to him to afford such studies.

People in Angola who are still alive knew personally this communist and murderous pig, as having only two shirts and only a couple of suits, how could this criminal afford to go to Russia for his Engineer degree, and if he had been there and made his degree (3 to 4 years minimum) then there is no time in the description of his activities and exiled years in Congo Brazzaville.

From the MPLA Web Site: """"Após a eclosão da luta contra a ocupação colonial, em 4 de Fevereiro de 1961, José Eduardo dos Santos, então com 19 anos, abandonou em Novembro desse mesmo ano o país e passou a coordenar no exterior a actividade da Juventude do MPLA(organismo de que é um dos fundadores). Integrou em 1962 o EPLA (Exército Popular de Libertação de Angola), participando na preparação das condições para a abertura da 2ª Região Político-Militar. Em 1963 foi o primeiro representante do MPLA em Brazzaville/ Congo. Nesse mesmo país, depois de terminados os seus estudos superiores, frequentou durante um ano um curso Militar de Telecomunicações, que o habilitou a exercer, de 1970 a 1974, sucessivamente as funções de Operador do Centro Principal de Comunicações da Frente Norte e Responsável-adjunto dos Serviços de Telecomunicações na 2ª Região Político-Militar do MPLA (Cabinda). Em 1974, José Eduardo dos Santos é designado membro da Comissão Provisória de Reajustamento da Frente Norte, responsável das Finanças da 2ª Região, e desempenha novamente as funções de Representante do MPLA em Brazzaville, até Junho de 1975.""""

http://web.archive.org/web/20100828013436/http://www.mpla-angola.org/opresidente.php

So lets hope that common sense sinks in, and that we can see what is obvious, and lets not allow the good nature on which the Wikipedia project was founded and based to be a place where totalitarian communist regimes use this space and wikipedia inadvertently is perceived as a tool to validate their Regimes, we therefore as freemen and humans, we must not allow this space to be used with the aim to prize this (or other) criminal murderous Communist Dictator.

Have a go with twinkle for a few weeks and get back to me and I'll see about giving it to you. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me. Call me Pat """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False
812224c52ab3fe94,"""A real problem has developed with the references, also Figure 1 has moved oddly and I can't get it back in place ==

To: Chzz
From: Howard Zimmerman

Chzz,

I had just figured out how to deal with References 4 and 5 and got them reasonably set up (at least to start).

But on looking at the article now, I see that the references are somehow in trouble and mixed up.

Another problem somehow developed. The drawing for Figure 1 is oddly placed.
I've attemted to give it more space, but the space is put partially before the caption
and the drawing doesn't move left but is oddly to the right.

Chzz, I appreciate your wanting to help. Especially in view of my uncertainty earlier about the referencing.

But is it possible to get the Article back to where it was this morning. I had just fixed up References 4 and 5.
I realize that I could improve them further but the basic job really was ok.

I think I can put the rest of the references in all right.

But I don't know if the article as it waa this morning is archived and can be retrieved.

If not, I can go through the article and see if I can get the right referencing. 

I haven't figured out exactly what went wrong. 

But Reference 3 should be to Krapcho and Bothner-By

Then Ref 4 should be to the 1961 Tetrahedron article

and Ref 5 to the Interscience 1973 article.

After that Ref 6 should be the Birch and Nasipuri 1959 article.

Chzz, if needed I can go through and experiment with fixing this up.

But I'm a bit uncertain about how to change the referencing although I can try.

AND, I don't know how to move the Drawing in Figure 1 to be to the left and centered.
while it was ok originally, my attempts to move it back haven't worked.

Thus if the article has been archived and can be gotten back, that would be simplest.

Chzz, it does appear that I've been the source of too much work for you. Neverheless
please do realize that I appreciate the help.

Best wishes,

Howard

Nothing is ever lost; the history shows all the previous versions, and all edits, back from when a page was made - see WP:HISTORY, and look at the page history.

I have tried to fix the refs from your description above - hopefully it is a bit better now; it's probably still not right, but considering most of it is correct, it might be easier to work from that. If you would rather just go back to the version before I edited it today though, that's easy enough, as explained above - or, let me know, and I'll put it back for you. Possibly it is easier to fix the existing, and refer back to this version.

Re. the figure, well, this is the problem I've been trying to describe. If you leave a number of blank lines to space the figures, then it might look OK to you, but it won't on another persons browser. You cannot rely on the text being the same size on their system, nor can you expect everyone to use a screen with the same resolution. This is a problem, with inserting images directly, rather than using the thumbnail system.  ►  

Two more things, to make our lives easier;

Please fix your signature, so it stops doing this 'unsigned comments' thing. To do that, click on 'my preferences', clear anything in the """"Signature:"""" box, and make sure that the checkbox """" Sign my name exactly as shown"""" is not checked.

When you make sections here (to leave messages), could you keep the title short? The long titles make it a bit unwieldy in the table of contents etc.

Neither are a huge problem; just trying to make things easier. Hope to hear more soon. [[User talk:Chzz|",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

No point of view in article titles is not a guideline.  In all cases, it is neutrality, and the NPOV POLICY, and the Naming conflict guideline that the policy summarizes all make it very clear that the existence of the ROC is not a consideration to deny that the most common usage of China is to mean the country we call People's Republic of China.
Wikipedia:NPOV#Article_naming Where proper nouns such as names are concerned, disputes may arise over whether a particular name should be used. Wikipedia takes a descriptive rather than prescriptive approach in such cases, describing corporate entities such as cities and states by the names by which they describe themselves (or by the English-language equivalent). Where inanimate entities such as geographical features are concerned, the most common name used in English-language publications is generally used. See Wikipedia:Naming conflict for further guidance.
The followup guideline, Naming conflicts, entirely disagrees with you.  The common name (in use by the world), the self-descriptive name (of the PRC), the official short name (ie, the UN) of the PRC is simply, """"China"""".  The guideline says that subjective criteria such as someone else's claim to the term China (ie, the ROC), should NOT be used as criteria to determine Wikipedia's usage.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

 B Kobres concedes work of Dr. Rex Curry http://rexcurry.net/wikipedia-lies.html 

B Kobres has conceded the historical discoveries of Dr. Rex Curry concerning symbolism under the horrid National Socialist German Workers' Party. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html  Even after conceding that the information could not be disputed, B Kobres nevertheless indicated his desire to suppress the information in order to maintain the intellectual errors that Kobres has mistakenly perpetuated in his past. A google post also covers the topic at
http://groups.google.com/group/alt.politics.libertarian/browse_frm/thread/86dd295af96947f6/b4429553f79b3675#b4429553f79b3675

Wikilings do their dirty work anonymously, hiding behind names that do not identify them because they are ashamed to admit who they are and what they do. The practice is so widespread on wikipedia that people like Kobres have inspired and acquired the term """"wikilings"""" and """"wikiling writers"""" as a reference to their bad behavior.  B Kobres deletes valid responses to the personal attacks and kookiness of himself and other """"wikilings""""; but, B Kobres does not delete the personal attacks and kookiness of other wikilings who write with him. Kobres protects the personal attacks and kookiness of wikilings who write with him. http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html  B Kobres deletes accurate information about the discoveries by Dr. Rex Curry that expose the history of Nazism in the USA.  http://rexcurry.net/wikipedia-lies.html  Wikilings delete anything, including even links, to accurate information. They delete accurate information that is posted on “discussion” pages, which are supposedly for discussion, but are not. Discussion pages are where wikilings insult people and then delete responses to the insults. Wikipedia is a completely untrustworthy source of information because it enables wikiling administrators to delete accurate information, but also to ban people who post accurate information, in order to prevent accurate information from being re-posted.""",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

    I appreciate your comments and I agreed with most of them.  I realized after you mentioned it that I needed to change the wording of one of the sentences under the Career heading.  I think it works a bit better now.  Creating hyperlinks for some key words was beneficial too.  However, in regards to creating a hyperlink for Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever - they are graduate students working with Geoffrey Hinton and do not have Wikipedia pages written on them, so I can't make any links for them.  As for the picture of the Hinton, Wikipedia seemed to give me a hard time for trying to upload a photo unless I had explicit consent from the owner of the photo.  I had contacted Hinton previously to get some information from him personally, but I got the sense that I was annoying him slightly as he said he was really busy and was terse in his responses, so I decided not to pursue him for the picture.

 wikipedia's censorship 

I looked up Bash Back (The sodomite terrorist group that attacked the Church in Michigan) on wikipedia  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_Back) just to see what liberal bias they would have. Under the section """"Antifascist action at 2008 Milwaukee Pridefest"""" Wakopedia says """"In response, Bash Back! Milwaukee planned a confrontation of the hate group."""" the """"hate group they are talking about is the NAZIs but then if the NAZIs are a hate group then Bash back must also be a hate group so I edited it to say """"In response, The hate group Bash Back! Milwaukee planned a confrontation of the hate group.""""

Since they also didn't have any topic for the new terrorist attack on the church I added a few lines & was attacked by the Admins. So they added the following paragraph
2008 Disruption at Mt. Hope Church in Lansing, MI

Bash Back! members disrupted a Sunday sermon at Mt. Hope Church in Lansing, Michigan on November 9th, 2008. They dropped a banner in the church, threw thousands of fliers, made out in front of the congregation, yelled """"Jesus was a Homo"""", pulled the fire alarm and initiated pro-gay chants. Mt. Hope is an Assemblies of God church which holds and promotes """"ex-gay"""" events and preaches that homosexuality is a sin.

I edited the first line of the paragraph to read """"Christaphobic Bash Back! members disrupted.... & added the following footnote 

""""Christphobia (from Greek Christós: Messiah; phóbos: fear, phobia) is an irrational fear of, aversion to, or discrimination against Christianity.""""

I took the defanition word for wors from Wakopedia's definition for Homophobia & just changed the Homo/Christos & Homo/ Christian parts.

For this I received the following note from the admin

The Blackest Night

Hey, I'm looking for people to help me out with the creation of this article, care to lend a hand?   
Because the entire run has been building toward this event, there is already a wealth of information through every issue which can be used in the article.   

 Hulk (Comics) 

One note off topic. THANK YOU for the book recommendation. I've been hoping to get Iron Man up to a good GA before the movie, and could NOT get any help sourcing his communist bent. Comic Book nation does that well!   

In library now, will check it out tonight. It's wan on actual Hulk analysis overall, esp. in relation to Grest. Weinberg's science of superheros, or Simcha Weinstein's Up UP and Oy vey, but it'll help, no doubt, with Hulk, and hopefully other articles. I'm also looking at Tales to Astonish, by Ronin Ro, but... it' a bit more history of Marvel than of the characters, and covers most of the major character creations ins a paragraph, LOL - shows that the focus changes the coverage.   

see here.   

 Popular Music Sites 

Hi Wesley,

You mentioned that PureVolume, being a website for bands to host mp3s, is not suitable as a source.  Is this because a source should be a 3rd-party human being who has done original research or synthesis?  I realize that PureVolume (and any site that collects and presents data about usage) can present results that are made inaccurate through sockpuppets, but it still ends up being less slanted and biased than human beings, don't you think?   

 Kitty Pryde 

Hi Wesley.  Thanks for helping out with the page.  I haven't read that issue yet, but I did read an issue summary, so I tried to edit it back to standards.  Thanks for fixing that one, though.  At least that nonsense is over now.

In biology, evolution refers to the processes that cause some inherited traits to become more common relative to others over time. Natural selection, the most important of these, works because some traits or collections of traits will, on average, increase reproductive success, either by protecting the organism from dying before it can reproduce, or by enhancing his reproductive success directly, such as the peacock's plumage. As genes are passed on by reproduction, those that increase reproductive success are more likely to be passed on, relative to neutral or relatively unfavourable traits, and so, generation to generation, the number of organisms with these traits will tend to increase, unless conditions change so as to make them no longer favourable. Other, less important mechanisms of change include gentic drift (random changes in frequency of traits, most important when the traits are, at that time, reproductively neutral), and the founder effect, in which, if a small group of organisms become isolated from the main population, that isolated population will, even many generations on, tend to have a higher frequency of any rare variations in the founders as compared to the original, larger population.

Over time, the accumulation of many of these inherited changes can result in the development of new species from existing ones,  a process called speciation. [Explain major routes of speciation: geographical differences, isolation, divergence into seperate niches, etc]

[Simple evidence, probably the Universal genetic code] and other discoveries have shown that this mechanism can be traced back to a single common ancestor, from which all living organisms on Earth descended as a result of cumulative evolutionary change over billions of years, making evolution responsible for the vast diversity of life on Earth, including the many extinct species found in the fossil record.

This article is about the first Pahlavi Shahanshah who toppled the Qajarid dynasty.

As for Germany, you are not really in a position to compare the brutality of Kemalist autocrats in the Third World (Where much of the society was still held at a tribal level and required strong leaders to commence modernization on a national scale), with the cold-blooded campaign of eradicating """"Untermenschen"""" in the name of Aryan purity (Of which, you are nothing but thieving Germanic apes) during the WW2.

Could the administation and users take an independent look for the following reversal of useful and pertinent contributions at the Mustafa Kemal Ataturk site please?

This section badly needs cleaning up. I am happy so to do but I should like to seek support, here, first. A prerequisite is that attendance at the school should be reliably sourced - no source must mean no inclusion. The second prerequisite is notability. A page is not needed to demonstrate notability but it helps! Looking at the red-links some have no claims to notability and for some the claims can be simply tested. Take Mike Pointing for example. If he has played in a competitive match for Harlequins first team then he meets WP:Athlete. If he has just played for their academy then he doesn't. If Michael Latham is an influential film-maker why doesn't he have a page? My view is that if an editor thinks that an alumnus is notable and feels strongly that they should be included in this list then write a stub! It is always quicker to write a stub than have a long debate trying to establish their notability separately.

To deal with this situation efficiently I am proposing that red-linked or unsourced people should be moved here. This preserves the information that we have about them and they can then be moved back to the article as sources are found or notability is demonstrated. Views, please.   

I'm with you, TerriersFan. Move the redlinks here or give a diff to the deletion; they can be added back when the burden of proof is met.

Kewl. I've read the application section through and can't find what the tone problem is. I've added an intext source note but even as the matter stood the section began """"according to Gurdjieff"""" and so far as I can see doesn't deviate from that attitude or tone. Where does it? Can you quote something objectionable? The section simply explicates the concept.

I understand the concern about promotion, and have seen plenty of articles on wikipedia which justify it, but I can't see that this is one of them. Also the referencing tag is mispalced.

This is not to say that the article as it stands has no problems apart from page numbers.

 Redirect from hoax page """"Hamlet of Denmark"""" 

Hello ! I just wanted to point out that the redirect that you created from Hamlet of Denmark should point to Prince Hamlet (which is the article dedicated to the character) and not to Hamlet. Best regards! (talk) 
 I thought about it, but the play also has King Hamlet, the ghost. (I have no preference either way; if you believe Prince Hamlet would have been a better target, I might reduce the protection for a while, so that you can change it.) -   
 Well, I confess that I have absolutely no idea about how to find whether people who search for """"Hamlet of Denmark"""" are more interested in the prince or in the king. I would say the prince, but it would be only a conjecture. Given the ambiguous nature of the expression, your choice seems the most reasonable. Sorry if I didn't give a better thought on it before contacting you. Cheers! (talk)

@Ian.thomson: Please talk about Wikipedia rules and do not tell insult word. I say that this is not a valid reason for speed deletion. The admin must stated it in talk page until solved.
  

@Mike Rosoft:Please reply to my question. Do is G11 rule in speed deletion? 
  
The draft presented lies by a known conspiracy theorist as """"meticulously research.""""  To call that promotional is better than that deserves.
WP:G11 says that """"Unambiguous advertising or promotion"""" is to be speedily deleted.  The lies David Duke wrote were promoted as """"meticulously research.""""

Speedy deletion of Rahul saboo
 A tag has been placed on Rahul saboo requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. -  (Talk to me)  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

OK , I think I understand what you are intending. As it stands your new category won't last very long as it is not nested into an appropriate higher level category. All categories sit in a nested structure which , if followed upwards, will always end with [[Category:Main topic classifications]] (I have surrounded this category with nowiki tags to avoid this discussion being categorised). To create an appropriate category, the simplest way is to go to the best relevant higher level category such as Category:American Singers and then works downwards through that until you reach a level where individual singers are listed.

If you want to make a message to that kdbuffalo comment page saying I cite an abundance of medical historians, medical/science journals which is the truth it would be appreciated.

Also, I believe this policy is being ignored:

 From the Members
Welcome to the Ninth issue of the WikiProject Christianity newsletter! Use this newsletter as a mechanism to inform yourselves about progress at the project and please be inspired to take more active roles in what we do.  

I am in the process of going through the various categories related to Christianity. I am finding that several of them may not have sufficient number of members to continue. By the end of the month, I hope to have the main category list finished (yeah, it might take that long, it's huge). At that time, I think we will review all the categories and see which may not have sufficient articles to continue. Please feel free to take part in the discussion regading what the minimum number of category items is, and how to deal with the non-qualifying categories, on the General Forum page.

 This article sounds like it was written by the UMWA 

It begins with adjectives like """"low"""" wages and """"poor"""" working conditions (against what standard?), and goes on from there.  I'm not saying that such those adjectives are wrong, simply that they are debatable (and have been debated for nearly a century).  It would be NPOV to say that the stikers were protesting their wages and working conditions, without the adjectives.  NPOV also requires a decent respect for the opinions of the owners who sincerely believed that unions were instigators of violence.

Also, unlike the prior comments in this discussion pertaining to certain unfortunate edits, I'm not saying that there weren't innocent and ill-willed parties in this event.  I'm simply suggesting that the history clearly coughs up both types of people on both sides of this conflict.

 WorldNet TPS 

Hi,

It appears that you have deleted a page which I had created. The page was titled 'WorldNet TPS'. I feel it was unfairly deleted.

The purpose of the page is to provide Wikipedia users with some background/history regarding WorldNet TPS. WorldNet is the second largest payment service provider in Ireland and it is important that web users who choose not to use the WorldNet website (worldnettps.com) can access information regarding the company on the most popular encyclopaedia in the world.

I would like you to review your decision to delete the WorldNet TPS page.

Kind Regards,

Dear Vrenator!
Nice to meet you. 

Yes, I do believe that you made an error removing my edit on the Jostein Gaarder page, having assumed that it was not constructive. 
However, I appreciate that you are open for a civil discussion, which is not as frequent nowadays as it should be. So, let's go (on my side not in native English, and I ask for your patience if the same could be said briefer).

Your first impression could have been that my adding the word """"controversial"""" after the """"and"""" in the subtitle """"Environmental and human rights activism"""" can be bias, as certain Wikipedia guidelines generally suggest about this word. Generally it may be true, but not if, as in this case, the paragraph itself factually speaks about the """"Gaarder controversy"""", and it opens to a whole session about that controversy.

Just the other way around; actually the existing title was a bias: because all the Journalistic Ethics Guidelines I've ever seen, state that titles should express more or less what is written within the article, and can't say the opposite.(Which, unfortunately, is a not unfrequently used way of bias; utilizing that much more people read the title than the whole paragraph, and the title remains in the minds, while the truth-qualifying statement somewhere inside the article runs unnoticed). 
How can the title be simply about his """"human rights activism"""" when there is a controversion mentioned in the article about his hate-speech against a whole nation and a religion? 
I don't suggest that the Wikipedia article condemn Jostein Gaarder, as I learned and think now he has fully deserved, but 'controversial' his human rights activity certainly is.  

Therefore I firmly believe that you should revert my edit: 
I added in the title the word """"controversial"""", as the paragraph itself proves it expressedly, in order to make it: """"Environmental and controversial human rights activism"""". Also, for balance, besides Gaarder's own views of his own op-ed, I added at the end, how some others see the case: 'But some others see this op-ed as an expressedly anti-Semitic document'"""" 

Bthw, about the whole Gaarder controversy subject in this Wikipedia article it feels strongly that the Gaarder side - for which it is a central issue - dented it rather succesfully as if almost only the Norwegian Jews found his op-ed """"offending the Jews and Judaism"""". In fact several serious works of others (see later) also condemned Gaarder's op-ed as terrible hate-speech.

At least one more change - addition - is required: where the  """"Gaarder controversy"""" session writes about """"others"""", it asks in blue [Who?] and I wanted to add there the best source I know (The Augean Stables website), but it seemed as if I was blocked to do so. 

So, if, as I suppose, you are sincerely interested to learn about the controversy, read: 'Open Letter to Jostein Gaarder: Fisking Crypto-Supersessionism' on http://www.theaugeanstables.com/multiple-part-essays/open-letter-to-jostein-gaarder-fisking-crypto-supersessionism/ .
This is a scholarly answer to Gaarder's every statement by an American historian, and it gives every chance to Gaarder to correct himself in a respectful way. What Gaarder has never done,he only said some vague self-justifications like 'it was written in a haste' and 'should have been worded more cautiously"""" - as if these could justify vehement hate speech by an authority.

As a summary, my edit is a very mild correction only to Wikipedia's Jostein Gaarder article, relative to the hate-speech he committed against a whole people and a religion, and has never corrected.       (P.s.: It can be more convenient to use e-mail - I willingly give you my address any way you suggest to do this. )

The article validates my concerns about Wikipedia. I imagine you'll edit it out, or delete it.

I suspect that the general public 'gets it' about Wikipedia, too.

It's regrettable that the folks who are the most knowledgeable about, and best able to use, the intracacies of Wikipedia's rules and regulations are also the people best equipted to use that knowlege to stifle newbies, and/or those who are less computer-savvy, who may make mistakes, or who haven't even yet heard about what a 'sock puppet' is, or RR32 rule, or whatever rules you and heah used to stifle my contributons.

I doubt you'll 'get it', nor do I care.  But, at the end of the day, just maybe   there's a chance that you'll actually understand the damage you do by your holier-than-thou attitudes, and arrogant computer-geek power-plays.

This is in no way meant to be a personal attack"""" on you or heah, or anyone else who edits in Wikipedia. It's simply the reaction of an ordinary guy, based on his observations and experiences after being stifled by those who dissagreed with his edits. You and heah, in addition to not agreeing with my edits, clearly have the superiour knowledge of how Wikipedia works, which made it easy for you to throw  down obstables to my postings, make false allegations of wrong doing, and activate Wikipedia's rules to either threaten to ban me or block me, or  as you did, to actually ban or block me. 

But the more important issue  and problem  is for Wikipedia itself; namely, that this kind of censorship is akin to the autoritarion rulers whose people are only allowed to see or read whatever the rulers deem suitable  which will, as I've said before, only serve to further diminish the already tarnished reputaton of Wikipedia.
