 Hi Peter, I'll look into this bug shortly. I will run a trace of your classifications and see if, indeed, some of the revisions do show up twice. This is pretty core functionality for something to go wrong and unnoticed for so long  although maybe it is specific to the WikiTrust queue  which does not see a lot of use. This is the user-name you were using? And you logged in with the same user-name both times, right?
 Can you describe what the scrolling issue is? I fret this could be a tougher fix  its not like I actually implement scrolling, this is just something Java provides. 
 Also, you'll generally find that the accuracy of classifications among the queues looks like """"Cluebot-NG > STiki > WikiTrust"""" (assuming everything is working correctly). This is of course, is dependent on a complex set of criteria, how many people have been using a particular queue lately, etc.

Fair use rationale for Image:BoxartforACAC.jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:BoxartforACAC.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box.

3d968ec4d3c739bf,"Anarchism versus Religion 

Anarchism what does it mean for this anarchist hobbyist?

Anarchism started the First World War over the anarchist assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria.  A anarchist decided to interrupt a world power practicing imperialism and assassinated the Archduke as he drove by the anarchist in the tiny nation of Serbia.  What the anarchist did not know is that there were a multitude of secret treaties among no less that fourteen nations including attitude from the Ottoman Empire and within weeks the world was at war as Serbia was invaded.

The result of the war that started in the tiny nation of Serbia is millions of deaths, chemical warfare, proof of machine gun and artillery fire, introduction of aviation into warfare, the Russian communist revolution, and a new world order that led to World War Two, since the Germans believed it was their leaders who failed them causing them to lose the war.

World War Two led to millions of deaths and a larger battlefield across the world including China and the Pacific Ocean (Japan was part of World War One, but the results were insignificant compared to the bloody battlefields of Europe).  The results of World War Two led to nuclear weapons, a space race, spy satellites, nuclear ships, nuclear bombers, nuclear missiles, communism across the world from communist Russia, United States being called imperialist due to being a world wide undefeated military power who is unafraid to invade anyone except the nations with the largest and best militaries (Iraq had a lager but sad capability military).  World War Two also led to the Cold War, Korean War, Vietnam War, and Desert Storm One that was the result of the former allies of World War Two dividing among themselves into two parties and fighting low intensity and hot wars across the world until the year 1991 including, for many families, three or more generations of military service from the United States.

Serbia as a result of the wars across the world of the 20th century has been subjected to the Muslims, Russians, United States, Germans, and civil war within itself and still has United States intervention this 21st century.  Under President Clinton Serbia was made smaller requiring a split of Kosovo and Serbia after a long bombing campaign that exhausted the stockpile of conventional United States missiles during the 1990s.

Serbia got its anarchy and is a backwards nation that has been under subjugation and gunfire since the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

Embrace anarchy and declare Heaven non-religion in a discussion section where Heaven is something of the Christian, Jewish, and Muslim faith where the other faiths are atheistic in nature and worship man by a code of conduct, then you should embrace anarchy and go live off the lands in a mountain.  You have little knowledge of mythology and I bet you have no idea what you are doing concerning religion other than your personal attitude.",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Relax guys. I'm sorry you thought it was rude; that's not what I was going for. I can be a poor judge of what will or won't be controversial. Just remember if you don't like it it's as simple as undoing it.

Now, Alec2011 says that I don't understand what the page is for. I'm sorry, there isn't anything that gives a specific """"mission statement"""" for the article anywhere. So can you tell me? Just going on my own, I figured that if people want to know which songs are on which albums, they would just go to the album articles themselves. So having them organized that way seemed redundant to me. It seems that the only point to having an article like this is to show where the songs appear in the series. Because there is so much overlap between where they appear in the series and where they appear in the albums I did it this way.

Hitler was quite right when he said that Admiral Graf Spee should have won the battle. She lost because of errors made by captain Langsdorff. Graf Spee outgunned all her opponents, having 11 inch main guns, to Exeters 8 inch and Ajax and Achilles 6 inch guns.

Langsdorff should have concentrated the fire on Exeter first before Admiral Graf Spee came into the range of the light cruisers.

Instead, Langsdorff split his fire between the three targets, with the result that although Exeter was severely damaged and forced to withdraw, the other ships got into range and scored 20 hits on Admiral Graf Spee, including on the food stores and bakeries.""",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Hi Tony, as far as I know, once you are a user in one Wikipedia, somehow you become a user in all/most of the others (including for example, Commons). I may be wrong in this, however I don't remember having created a user id and password in the Spanish Wikipedia yet I have an account there.

In any event, part of the “secret” has something to do with something called “unified logins” and you can find which wikipedias you are “attached” to by going to >>>>  My Preferences > Basic Information > Global Account status > Manage your global account

I don’t know how it decides which wikis to attach you to and which ones not (for example, I am not attached to Wikitravel), but what the heck? it works for the Spanish, English, and Commons which is where I spend 99% of my wiki time.

I have been editing the Spanish Wikipedia and will probably do so even more in the future: it allows me to reach the other 50% of Puerto Ricans that don’t read English fluently. (Check out my article in teh Spanish wiki for Millito Navarro – I started by translating it from the English Wiki and now the Spanish version is not only more complete than the English counterpart, but also has 3x the references, is more current and, probably most importantly, it has an accurracy that can be backed up 100%. You know, I can't be contect with incomplete articles if the rest of teh info is readily available.) 

I will be more than happy to fulfill you request for the move; and have already sone so.  I had read negative comments about the Spanish Wikipedia related to how much more problematic it was to edit, how editors there didn’t know what they where doing, and how there seem to be not a fully developed system for dealing with conflicts etc. Some (a little?) of that may be true; the rest may be perception only. I am learning the ropes there and stay out of trouble by creating/editing article most people don’t care about for now (read: Ponce – haha), but once interest develops I know I have the truth well “under my belt” to deal with the sporadic drive-by editor that wants to make changes based on unacceptable motives (personal, political, etc – you know what I am talking about) rather than verifiable truth.   

Also, its very easy to jump (to appear logged in and all) from one wiki to the other: just take an article in the English wiki which you know also exists in Spanish wiki and hit the link on the left that says “Spanish” and bingo!!!! you are there! I use “Cerro de Punta” because it exists in both wikis AND because it is short and, thus, I don’t have to scroll down to see the “Spanish” link.

 Edit warring on Pro-Israel bias section 

The Pro-Israel bias section has been repeatedly blanked. As another editor stated when restoring the information, """"We have Camera and the like in the article.

I found an Associated Press report from after World War I that states that Bethmann-Hollweg was partly of Jewish extraction.  I added this to the personal information about Bethmann-Hollweg, along with a link to a PDF of the article in the New York Times.  All I said was that according to this article, he was of Jewish extraction. That is a demonstrably, undeniably true statement!  It definitely was stated in an AP report that appeared in the New York Times that Bethmann-Hollweg was of Jewish descent.  Why then would somebody keep removing this reference?  GoodMorningWorld has done this several times. He claims that it is CERTAINLY not true, but IT IS CERTAIN that the AP said it and that it appears in the New York Times.  If GoodMorningWorld has some argument that the claim in the AP story was wrong then he should post it in the text of the article along with the claim.  Otherwise he appears to be trying to censor information that he finds disagreeable. Who the hell does he think he is?  
I explained to you why including this information in the article is inappropriate, on your Talk page on July 2: """"It doesn't matter what some foreign correspondent for the NYT mistakenly wrote 90 years ago if we know with certainty that it is false. The only reason to include it in the encyclopedia would be if the false report had turned into an incident in its own right. In that case, some brief mention might be warranted. Otherwise, no."""" Wikipedia is not an indiscrimate collection of information.   

You haven't explained anything that matters.  You assert that the information is false, despite the eminence of the source, and the information is to be suppressed based on nothing more than your say-so.  Why you believe that it is false is your own secret; it is clear only that you do not want to allow it to be discussed. I do not think that this kind of dogmatism and censoriousness represent an appropriate attitude for someone contributing to an encyclopaedia. 

Since there is a section of the article that discusses Bethmann-Hollweg's ethnic heritage, I think it is clearly relevant that he was identified by the Associated Press and the New York Times in his own lifetime as a person of Jewish descent. The Associated Press and the New York Times are normally considered credible journalistic sources, so that the burden of proof rests on you to show that what was reported was false. If you really know what you pretend to know, that Bethmann-Hollweg was not a person of Jewish descent, then prove it.   
I'm growing really tired of Hadding's belligerent, know-nothing approach to encyclopedic articles. Wikipedia isn't some game where you fire up Google, find a hit, then carry that snippet back here and wedge it into an article, without knowing anything at all about the article subject and therefore being in no position to evaluate its accuracy. I am reverting Hadding's repeated insertion of false information. Hadding, consider this your only warning. If you continue this destructive and harmful approach I will report you to an admin noticeboard. Alternatively – if you want to demonstrate a sincere interest – then learn German and read this passage in a book by historian Fritz Fischer, which speaks of B.-H.'s parentage. Or just read the goddamn Wikipedia article which already contains that information.   

That is not a """"passage"""" about """"Bethmann-Hollweg's parentage.""""  That is a chapter about Bethmann-Hollweg as chancellor, from a book about Hitler. I do not believe that the claim from the Associated Press and New York Times about Bethmann-Hollweg's Jewish ethnic heritage is addressed whatsoever in that book.  

If there is a sentence in that book that you think makes your case then why don't you cite it?  

I hope that you do call in the administrators, because I would like to call attention to a certain paranoid mind that believes that there is some conspiracy spanning the entire internet with the purpose of misrepresenting certain people as Jews. To wit, from the history page of the Bethmann-Hollweg entry:

Easy enough,
Semi-randomly; when I sit down to do some editing, my starting point is always one of 3 places: Monitoring new page creation (New Page Patrol), monitoring recent changes or existing items on my watch list (items accumulated from the above 2). Any article I tag for deletion was either originated from #1 or #2 above, or was linked to in one of the above.
Generally I don't discriminate; if I see 3 very similar articles worthy of deletion or at least a deletion discussion (AfD), all 3 will be up for a nomination. I qualify that with """"generally"""" because I don't always have the time/energy/desire/etc to do all that work. In that case I'll add the others to a """"to do"""" list or my watch list. However, if 1 or 2 of those 3 articles are better off (e.g. topics that are clearly notable, but no one's taken the time to dig up sources, or the article already has better sources), I'll use the appropriate cleanup tag (ones that indicate the article needs additional sources). It always comes down to the quality of the sources; a single mention in a nationally published news source (e.g. NY Times) carries a lot more weight than scattered blog postings or trivial mentions.

A merger is probably a good idea.  First, the prehistoric man article is terrible.  In fact it shouldn't exist as anything other than a stub.  The term """"Prehistoric man"""" is no longer used by scholars and hasn't been since the 1970's becuase it is androcentric and because there really is no such thing as a group or type of people who are characteristically """"prehistoric"""".  In other words, people in prehistoric societies have no particualar commonalities except a lack of writing.  Prehistory is a rubric used by scholars to differentiate the methods used to study the past, not a type of people.  There is no such thing as a stage of personhood or social development in which a person is a prehistoric man or woman.  For example, the Inca remained a prehistoric people until the Spanish conquest and yet they ruled one of the most impressive empires on earth and still had no writen records (quipa were memory aids, not writing).  In Central America, the prehistoric period starts more than a thousand years earlier.  Further, the term is Eurocentric and based on the notion of progressive stages of """"mankind"""" like the """"stone age"""".  There are people who still use stone tools.

 Terms not concepts

Well from the offerings you have made on your wiki, blog and elsewhere, you would certainly be a gem of an editor here. Your comments on the 10 commandments to save world fisheries and your notion of a Pacific Islands Fisheries Management Index move in directions I think the Wikipedia articles should. It's true that Wikipedia is more anonymous and constrains, in that you cannot present original research, but must instead back up statements with verifiable sources. It is an encyclopedia, so the encyclopediac game must be played. But still, that doesn't have to be that constraining, and Wikipedia has many advantages. The demand to be encyclopediac can often help cut through bull shit and starkly clarify where new research is needed. Important current issues that cannot be adequately sourced can still be discussed in the talk pages, and strategies can be developed so they may eventually get appropriate external sources. Well structured articles will be here to stay. They can have modest starts, but if properly framed will lend themselves to incremental improvements over time. Your articles need not drop off the edge of the blogosphere or disappear into the limbo of deceased wikis. They will have far more traffic and outreach than blogs or personal wikis can ever have. The traffic should increase with time. And of course you can still personally invite collaborators. An article on Pacific Islands Fisheries could be set up as a start to your index project, and a very nice article it could be too. We could work it up to FA. I think """"commandments"""" for sustainable fisheries is probably the single most important topic in the Fisheries and Fishing WikiProject, and I'm sure we could eventually get that humming nicely in attention grabbing but encyclopediac ways across a number of articles.

a dialect like the many Greek dialects. noone has that evidence. on the contrary all point to macedonian being a Greek dialect. even before 3rd century BC. check out the Pella Curse tablet. you seem to purposely avoid that kind of rock solid facts. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pella_curse_tablet
but i assume good faith and i tell you for your sources to overlap those there already you need to overlap these too>>http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Macedonia
as well as something else than """"doubt"""". your doubt about Alexander is not a source nor a factual analysis. and you need to find a way with which Macedonians who """"supposedly"""" did not speak Greek managed to all """"learn"""" and call themselves Greek by the 3rd Century BC.
not to mention the fact that nationalism was a matter of life and death especially to Greeks and all nations of that time. mixings were not like mixed-race Brazilians. those were ancient times. not your today balkan/european village. you could get killed for being mixed or from lower nations back then in Greece. not become a King.

If you look at Wikipedia Bosanski only latin is used (Whether it be fr pratical reasons or not). This does go along with my point that latin is used (MOSTLY, Almost always). If cyrillic was really official like it is in Serbia, then the Bosnian Wikipedia would be both in cyrillic and latin (like the Serbian Wikipedia it is in both). The Bosnian Wikipedia says that it uses the latin script for pratical reasons (such as: people do not have the cyrillic keyboard, etc.) Well this goes along with my point that it is not used as much. People do not have cyrillic keyboards like the people in Serbia.

Offical newspapers in Bosnia are not in cyrillic. They are in latin. (Slobodna Bosna, Oslobodjenje, Ljiljan, Nezavisne Novine (For all ethnicities), neither are their websites. Cyrillic is most commonly used in Serbia.

How are you going to use a Wikipedia Article to prove your point. Now where does it say that it is 100% correct. I had problems with the German Wikipedia on Bosanska Dubica, they claimed that Hrvatska Dubica and Bosanska Dubica were the same town/municipality. This is just crazy. Anyways I will never understand why people, who have no clue about where Dubica is or have never before heard about the town, write about it. My point is that people can write things on a biased level. They showed me websites as proof, but websites cannot be used as refrences in the United States for grammar school projects. Websites can never be trusted.

I mentioned this before, www.google.ba uses Bosnian and Croatian in latin, but if you want to search google.ba in cyrillic then you have to click Serbian to search google.ba in cyrillic.

I also looked at several different translation websites and found that if you want to translate into Bosnian, then you are translating into latin (Bosnian). However, for Serbian it gives you an option (latin or cyrillic).

In the world Bosnian is viewed by Bosnians and by the rest of the world as using the latin script.

Then explain to me why the Serbian template does not have latin and cyrillic. 

I would have to say that only Srpsko-Hrvatski should have both, but the languages that have split from Yugoslavia, should be chosen by its users. If you want to changed the Bosnian template than use it. Please do not change something you do not feel represented by.

The country of Bosnia and Herzegovina recognizes the three languages: Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian. Serbian is the one that uses cyrillic and that is how it is offical in Bosnia. The Bosnian language does not tend to use cyrillic",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Your talent at invoking """"personal attack"""" seems to exceed your talent at replying intelligently to any of my points.

If you can't take the heat, you shouldn't be editing an encyclopedia.  It's pretty clear that Wikipedia's """"personal attack"""" policy is simply a ploy to ban people with whom the administrators disagree, and prevent them from making contributions to Wikipedia, while at the same time preserving the illusion of some level playing field for intellectual discourse.  

To illustrate this point, we need look no further than the items removed by Jimbo from the Justin Berry talk page, citing """"personal attack"""", which included every mention of the term """"camwhore,"""" which is itself a Wikipedia topic, and the following paragraph.  Please feel free to try and figure out who is the victim of the """"personal attack"""" here.

""""I'm dissapointed that the majority of this page was deleted, most likely because one of the editors is a self-admitted pedophile. Is it fair to declare that a pedophile can't be neutral on a page that involves pedophilia?. I guarantee that wikipedia wouldn't ban a Jew from editing a page on the holocaust, or ban a black person from editing a page on affirmative action. A pedophile is just as capable of editing with a neutral POV on a subject matter dealing with pedophilia, as a Jew or a black would be on an issue that involves Jews or blacks. Wikipedia claims to be a online encyclopedia that anyone can edit. If that doesn't include pedophiles, than how is that fair?. If we allow certain sexual minorities to be silenced, what's next?, allowing certain racial minorities to be silenced as well. As a frequent reader and occasional editor of wikipedia, I only want to read factual, neutral POV articles, and I don't care about the race, nationality, ethnicity, sex, or sexual orientation of the editor. Even if most people have moral objections to pedophilia, surely we can agree that we all have a right to post on wikipedia as long as we abide by the rules.""""  TAB

The topic of mutual intelligibility in Slavic languages is a bit difficult. For example, Bulgarian is routinely regarded as a language most distant from the Slavic type and very difficult to understand for most Slavs. In Czech, there even exists a saying """"speaking like a Bulgarian"""" for unintelligible speech. Yet the difficulties in understanding lie mainly in grammar (the non-existence of word-endings, the use of articles). You can listen to a Bulgarian, not to understand a word and doubt, if you are actually listening to an Indo-European language - and then you see a Bulgarian text and you are surprised that you can read it quite with ease. So the difference in understanding spoken language and written language can be huge. 
As for the difference between Czech/Slovak and Polish, I must agree with the Polish contributor above that a fluent conversation is not possible. Yet you can certainly understand a lot and conduct some conversation, if you try to be patient. So """"a limited intelligibility"""" would be a more correct term. As for written Polish, Czechs and Slovaks shouldn't have any difficulties with a general understanding Polish text, although quite a few words (especially of technical sort) may seem obscure and untintelligible. However, the closest Slavic language to Czech (after Slovak) is Lusitan Sorbian, especially Upper Sorbian. I don't have any personal experience with this language, but from the written texts I saw I think that its resemblance to Czech can be compared to East Slovakian dialects (which means that you can understand some passages easily, but subsequently you can be lost due to accumulation of weirdly sounding words.)

Cruft in trivia section
A backstage segment featuring dancing is certainly fancruft that doesn't belong. It being a reunion of sorts (and it being at WM) doesn't make it any more notable at all. The dance segment didn't affect any of the matches and certainly doesn't help the article.  
I suggest moving to the notes section.   3:16 
It's always been in the notes section, that's not the problem here. The problem is: it's a backstage segment. Backstage segments aren't notable, and don't affect the matches or anything... why add this one over others? Just because it was a reunion isn't a good enough reason in my opinion. People certainly could argue the Boogey Man/Trump segment was notable, as it featured the first time the 2 had interaction (or just on the fact Trump appeared). It's fancruft and serves no purpose except that some people might think it's """"interesting"""". That's not enough to keep it on the article.  
Oh I didn't see that. Hmmm... let me see what I can do with it...   3:16 

I think that we should just add them to the other talent section if they aren't there already and not mention the dance. It was pretty pointless, and doesn't seem necessary. Peace,  The rid 
While I agree that the Boogeyman segment wasn't notable, this segment had the return of Slick (first time in like 15 years) and a bunch of other WWE legends. It being a reunion and at WM does help its case IMO (especially the reunion part). You are saying being a backstage segment is the problem, so you wouldn't be objecting if they had done this on the stage or in the ring? If we mentioned them in the on screen talent section, what would we put down for them so someone else doesn't remove it. It also got covered in most reviews and coverage of the event (coevering the notability part). Being cruft is an opinion; being a reunion featuring over a dozen legends and covered by almost every review makes it worth at least mentioning.  

Eh, the return of Slick is pretty important. I'll change my vote to Weak Support, as I had forgotten about that point. Peace,  The rid 
Covered in almost every review? I find that very hard to believe. Provide some proof. Also: so what if it's covered? The matches are reviewed in the reviews as well: that doesn't mean we will start listing highlights for each match. I also recall there being a guideline on Wikipedia about it not being a democracy: meaning not everything should be determined by a vote. I somehow think if this fancruft was gone: no one would be re-adding except for TJ. From the edit history: it seems like he was the only one re-adding it back. That certainly shows that people don't care about it. A few talk page posts in favor of it: isn't much consensus to keep it on the article.  
 and  among others. Other people have added it back, I just get to it first usually.  
Considering OWW is a fansite, only the Slam link is reliable. Anyone can write a review and mention it: fansites aren't a reliable source. I've seen no edit history of anyone else re-adding it back, so I'm still going to believe no one else has (until I see otherwise). If I need to bring an admin into this, I will. Because in my opinion: it's a content dispute between me and TJ, as no one else seems to care much about ONE LITTLE crufty thing. Slick returned for ONE appearance, post it on the Slick article and leave it at that.  
I could find more if I tried, that was in a quick 1 minute search. I could flip it and say only you think it should be removed. I don't see the big deal. It's not cruft, it's notable (based on what counts as being notable), an",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

As far as I know it has been stated that several """"universes"""" do not fit into the actual accepted universe of Wold Newton which integrates with the DC comics universe thanks to Alan Moore. Thus Marvel only corresponds to the universe due to the cross-over connections or with the exception of Steven Rogers and Peter Parker whose worlds do not clash with the DC Universe chronology. As for Star Wars it is speculated that it could be linked to the Wold Newton Universe, only Star Wars takes place in an entirely different future-past element, basically a universe that predates that of the Earth. And Tolkien's universe is also out of context due to the complex mythology that has no links outside of its realm, the same applies to Dungeons & Dragons, World of Warcraft and Warhammer. However the world of faeries is related thanks to King Arthur and Shakespeare as well as C.S. Lewis and Hans Christian Anderson/Brothers Grimm. Harry Potter's world also doesn't tie in to the Wold Newton as far as I have seen. And as for Looney Tunes and Disney the only way they might tie-in is through WHo Framed Roger Rabbit which has as of yet to be linked. Of course this is still a lot of debate as to what fits in and what doesn't, the only reason I added the list was to inform the reader as to why the characters from those """"universes"""" or """"worlds"""" were not present. Perhaps it could be stated that although they are not """"accepted"""" within the universe it is yet to be seen whether or not they are truly acknowledged as being apart from it as a whole.

Could it be made explicit as to whether the European common cuckoo is the only species that lays eggs in another bird's nest?  Thanks 

It's definitely not. Oriental Cuckoo, Great Spotted Cuckoo and others are nest parasites, but I don't have a defititive list. Other birds, apart from cuckoos, also do this (like the cowbirds).

               Dr.I.K.Gill
       He has devoted his life for the needy
Not long ago Dr.I.K.Gill an expert in psychology and physical education came over to Pakistan from Germany. He held workshops in special education and physical education. Under the leadership of Dr.Gill workshops were held in Karachi as well as in Lahore. In Karachi workshops, teachers from special education institutes attended under his able leadership. Teachers from Punjab and North Frontier Province attended the similar courses in Lahore.
Dr.I.K.Gill taught mental health and physical education for handicapped children. During these workshops he instructed the teachers how to teach children in physical movements so that they are able to lead their lives as normal human beings and they do not remain dependant on others.
Dr.I.K.Gill originally comes from Pakistan. He was born 1924 in a village in Sialkot District. He was born in a poor home therefore he had to labour hard in the fields. However, he was keenly interested in acquiring education. He did his primary schooling in his own village and did his high school graduation at C.T.I. High School, Sialkot. After high school he joined the army and served his country in British India Government.  After release from the army he worked in Government College of Physical Education, Walton. Lahore as a superintendent and teacher.
In 1956 he got a chance to go for higher studies in Germany in a college of physical education along with the university of  Cologne, Germany. After graduation from Germany, he went to the University of Graz, Austria for Ph.D. Having completed his PhD he went back to Germany and worked as a teacher of physical education. During his service he happened to see a photo in a church magazine, which alerted his life profoundly for ever. They were the images of people suffering from leprosy. The moment he saw a fellow countryman, he was shaken through and through. At that moment he decided to go to Pakistan. Within a short time by the Grace of God through the German Leprosy Relief Association he landed in Pakistan with his newly wedded wife.
He started his work in Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre in Karachi (e.g.the Leprosy Colony in a hut behind McLeod Road, later a building was bought in Frere Road in Saddar Bazaar)
From 1962 to 1970 Dr, Gill worked for the welfare of Leprosy patients in Pakistan. 
Dr. Gill said about his mission “I always wanted to know those unfortunate people who are dependant in one way or the other upon others. My ambition was to teach such people to be able to do their own work and lead an independent happy life. Such unfortunate people are victim of unhappiness and misery, therefore my yearning was to help and work for the welfare of such weaker sections of community. So I thought I must involve myself in a difficult mission. For such vital mission I chose to come to my own beloved country Pakistan”. Dr. Gill concentrated his special attention  on backward and handicapped children in Pakistan because  in his opinion today’s child is a responsible citizen, a child is tomorrow`s father being the builder and protector of the next generation. Therefore to educate him or her today is very important. Dr. Gill said that besides food and refuge is necessary for these children but undoubted education most important.  Dr. Gill revealed that he is very surprised to discover that parents of these unfortunate children have no ambition to educate these disadvantaged children. Today children are expected to contribute in the family income and expenditure. Let’s say that handicapped children cannot do so, but if they educated to look after their needs themselves and their person, they do not remain dependant upon others for the whole of their lives. Special education can make life easier and productive.
TABIn view of his services from 1962 -70 Government of Pakistan invited Dr.I.K.Gill to Pakistan. He came back to train teachers of physical and special education, so that these teachers could provide special education to needy children in their respective areas. 
Dr. Gill provided this facility in Lahore, Islamabad, and Karachi. He stayed and carried on his services for about eight weeks to complete series of lectures.
He also came back this year again to carry on series of special education training which took place in Lahore and Karachi. He appreciated greatly that three universities accepted the challenge and established the departments of special education. Dr. Gill trained forty teachers both in Lahore and Karachi who would further train teachers in special education. Therefore the number of teachers will be increased. 
Dr. Gill used modern techniques i.e. videos used in Germany, movies, wheelchairs, small sandbags, balloons and many more others. It was shown how",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Comment about JJ Bulten

Greetings,

I would like to mention that I added 0% of the """"OR"""" tags and thus am innocent. I realize that when someone is trying to find a compromise, it is easier to blame """"both sides"""" for a conflict. However, on closer inspection, I would be willing to bet that a judge or jury would find that I am arguing on the merits of the Wiki-policies and outside sources, while JJB is using scorched-Earth tactics. Please consider this example:

    The evidence does not favor backing off from requesting a move, for compliance's sake, in some other polite way. First, the """"vote"""" remains 6-4 by my count: no consensus. Second, your unsourced statement of thousands of """"longevity myths"""" cites is probably a Google exaggeration based on estimated mirrors; see above where I sourced the real numbers as 92 vs. 91. Third, this exaggeration only reflects the fact that a vast number of """"myth"""" mirrors stem from Ryoung's wholly unsourced 2005 insertions. (The User:Shii/Hoaxes page normally considers this as evidence of hoaxing. See User talk:Shii/Hoaxes#Longevity, ticklish situation for 26 phrases originating from Ryoung that have exactly zero Google support outside his 2005 insertions.)

            Yet another FALSE accusation. There is no """"hoaxing"""" here at all, nor has there been any attempt at """"hoaxing."""" I am not responsible for third-party sites, but if they choose to copy my work, might it be because they consider it a reliable source?Ryoung122 

                Comment: Looking closer, we see that it was JJB that listed this as a """"hoax"""":

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Shii/Hoaxes#Longevity.2C_ticklish_situation

Citation of one's own accusation is a circular argument, and thus invalid.

In other words, JJBulten first adds material to Shi's page then cites his own add as """"proof"""" of hoaxing. Actually, it's only proof of his fanaticism, of hitting 'below the belt' in an attempt to radically remake this page in his own image. """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

ae7e01fa4c952931,""":::: sprot only blocks IP (and brand new) addresses from editing - it does not stop anyone from reading, nor does it stop anyone who wants to contribute to create an account with an unidentifiable and untraceable name (i.e., don't give your email address) and contribute.  The edits made by multiple IP addresses on this page, as you know,  have been (not always but  by and large) at best unhelpful but much more often downright offensive and I see absolutely no reason why that should be allowed to continue.  Again, you know I am not talking about the juvenile HI MOMs - they are also annoying, but that is not what plagues this page.  We are plagued by targeted vandalism - changing """"Obama"""" to """"Osama"""", for example, and the regular changing of text that has hidden text clearly requesting that it not be changed right there, plus blatant POV pushing, trolling, etc.  Classic case for permanent sprot. The result, when sprot is in place, is the ability to conscientiously edit and improve the article (which has a changing base of facts so needs constant attention).  But rather than being able to easily evaluate substantive changes that responsible editors make, we are bogged down in having to go through screen after screen of pure and often vicious vandalism. For what positive reason, may I ask?

IP edits also can be used, I suppose, by regular editors who don't want to reveal that they are making sub rosa changes, but I would hope that is not going on here.  

And IP addresses have quite rarely reverted vandalism here - in fact I just looked at the last 500 edits and didn't see a single case of an IP address reverting vandalism. Maybe I missed one, but that claim was not really reflective of what goes on on this page - it is a very small group of actual editors who do the vast majority of the reverting.  

Your comment above about there being only one vandalism on Dec 21 was just one day after sprot was lifted the last time. I said then that I hoped to be wrong, but predicted that vandalism would be back up and it is.  That's why I requested extended protection.

If what  you were unhappy about is the tag itself, I also thought all along that we should have {{sprotect2}} and had thought to change it last time but the block was lifted before I had a chance to.   I have changed it to that less obtrusive tag.  The question of the duration  of the lock is what I am interested in. Two-three weeks is much better than what we had a few weeks ago, and may coincide with any announcement that Senator Obama makes which is also good timing for sprot, but  I'd like to understand why you would want it not to be an extended one, because I can't make any sense out of your position on this, as a person (you, I mean) who clearly is interested in having this remain a high quality page, as evidenced by the excellent work you do here, and the fact that this page has been by far your main area of Wikipedia editing.    | talk

Scott, i think that is evidence that you still just don't get it.  this has nothing to do with string theory.  string theory is non-sequitur.  i hardly understand string theory (really, just the pop stuff Brian Greene puts on Nova), but i fully understand the argument that, in reality, the only physical quantities that we measure, that we perceive, that make any difference to anything that involves us as human beings (or E.T. beings, for that matter) are dimensionless quantities.  when something changes that affects us, ultimately it's a dimensionless measure, usually the ratio of like dimensioned quantities.  we always measure a dimensionful quantity against another like dimensioned quantity.

if  changed (let's say got bigger), conceptually, that would have meaning, the electromagnetic force (relative to the other fundamental interactions) would have changed in proportion (gotten a little bigger).  then it would appear that the charge of an electron has gotten a little bigger (but it might not have) or that Planck's constant has gotten a little smaller (but it might not have) or that the speed of light has gotten a little smaller (that's the choice you and authors such as Moffat made) or even (if we're gonna say that  might have changed) that the permittivity of free space has changed (like ,  is defined in many measurement systems, such as SI or cgs).  (i doubt anyone will argue that it's  or  that has changed.)  heck, someday soon (i would expect within a decade)  will be defined (because of a redefinition of the kilogram).  if they do that, then a change in  gets blamed on a change of , which still seems most natural to me, but that's my opinion.  even so,. if they did that to  and  was measured to have changed, i would not argue that all of the electrons and protons and positrons in the universe have somehow transferred charge.  i would say that they appear to have a different charge since their strength of their interaction has changed (which is fundamentally all a change in  can mean).  that is all we would know or could ever know.  to blame any conceptual change of  on a change of any of the dimensionful ingredients to it, is silly.  16:04, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

You assume a lot. I don't """"support Storms,"""" it's not personal. Storms is reliable source of a kind that requires caution: he is clearly affiliated with cold fusion research. However, who should write a book on the topic? Someone who has no experience with it? Storms isn't simply editorializing, expressing his opinions, he shows the basis for those opinions with meticulously referenced text. As with any review of the field, he cites research according to his opinion of what is relevant, and this, then, gives us a guide to what is notable in the field. There are thousands of peer-reviewed papers on cold fusion, and even more  much more  if we allow conference papers. He can use conference papers, we can't, but if he cites them, that makes them sufficiently notable for our reference. Because of the position of the field as to """"general opinion""""  very unclearly defined  we have to present everything in the field as controversial, including what is quite well-established, such as excess heat. If you don't think excess heat is reasonably well-established, you should read the 2004 DoE review again, and I could cite reliable sources that the work is sound. The claim that it's all junk research, quite simply, can't be supported from any solid source, only from what are, really, tertiary sources as Hipocrite is now using at the article, in place of the much stronger Storms reference, which is a secondary source. It's like the media reports that Fleischmann's work was never replicated.

In fact, the core claim, that excess heat was found when setting up highly-loaded palladium deuteride, has been confirmed over and over. The original radiation claims were bogus. The research finding neutrons at moderate levels was bogus, artifact and error. The claim that the origin is nuclear, and in particular that it is """"fusion,"""" is unproven. In other words, OCMV, I'm quite with the 2004 DOE review, except that the field has shifted since then, the evidence for nuclear effect is stronger, a clear and consistent pattern has emerged from a review of all the research, such that negative replications typically, now, can be seen as confirmations of a general hypothesis forming, but no clear proof that the basic process is fusion.

For example, the SPAWAR group shows energetic neutrons. The work is solid and published. Aspects of it have been confirmed, and I am, indeed, assuming that there will be more confirmation; their work, over almost twenty years, has been quite solid and conservative, they've done proper controls, etc. The levels, however, are very low, and this kind of phenomenon has always been used as an argument against cold fusion: there are all these apparently contradictory experiments. I was just reading yesterday one protest that """"all these experiments produce different amounts of heat, how come there is no consistency?"""" """"So what if you find neutrons, this is inconsistent with the reported heat.""""

Actually, it isn't. What that shows is that neutrons aren't involved in whatever is generating the heat, but that the energy source, what I call the black box, is capable of creating conditions where a little hot fusion takes place. For example, take the Be-8 hypothesis. That will generate energetic alphas at 23.8 MeV. These can cause some hot fusion to take place at a low level, indeed, it would be expected. The alphas are found, confirmed, Miles et al's work showed, way back, that helium generation is correlated with excess heat. No excess heat, no helium. Excess heat, helium, in an amount proportional to the excess heat, and the ration is at 25 +/- 5 MeV, as reported by Storms and others. Krivit thinks this is a bogus figure, but I'm not convinced that Krivit understands the problem. If you don't capture all the helium, you will get a higher figure, and that is, indeed, what is found, but with some experiments, great care has been exercised to detect all the helium, and that gets us tightly toward the expected figure from d-d helium fusion, 23.8 MeV.

One writer put this way: Fleischmann didn't just discover some isolated island, that could be specified by simple coordinates, he found an entire continent, and those who try to find the island find different things, their reports vary all over the map, literally. We do not know to what extent low-energy nuclear reactions are possible. Storms details a list of observations that it would be desirable for a CF theory to explain. This does not mean that he thinks all these findings are artifact-free.

Elemental transformation under conditions that produce the excess heat phenomena is now quite well confirmed, overall. The field suffers from a lack of highly specific confirmation; this results from the conditions under which the work has been done.

You made an obviously bad call about Protonk, a well respected and long term contributor to this project based on what you term a BLP violation. You state in your comments that this was supported by other admins when anyone who takes the time to actually go there and read the comments will see, that no one supported your decision. This caused a moderate admin to leave the project completely only to allow less moderate admins like yourself more room to exert influence. After reviewing the comment Protonk made, I certainly agree it was a bad comment, but it was absolutely not worthy of a block without any sort of warning or talk page message and it was no worse than your outburst of telling all the editors in an RFA they are Fucking morons"""" because you were the submitter of the RFA and likely had your feelings hurt. An event I note that you were not blocked nor even approached about and as far I can find have never openly apologized for. Although there may be a comment somewhere I do admit. 
You have a tendency to exaggerate in your favor such as can be seen in the previous statement when determining that there was support to summarily block Protonk when there clearly was nt. This can also be seen in reviewing some of the cases on your talk page and talk archives.
As mentioned above, and as noted by several individuals, your Fucking morons''' comment is still too new and does not represent the attitude needed or wanted of a functionary.
You recently unblocked  and revoked his topic ban knowing this user had a long history of Personal attacks and trolling regarding gender topics and gamergate. Within 24 hours that user was again blocked for personal attacks, has continued to stir the pot and make drama and has been drug to at least ANI and Arbcom within the last week as can be seen on their talk page and the mentioned venues.
Even based on your comments here, you clearly have an attitude of knowing better than everyone else whats good for Wikipedia. That arrogance is inappropriate of a functionary.
You give a staggering number of over 13000 blocks and claim it as an achievement. Personally, I see this as proof of your tendency to block first and ask questions later. There is no way you scrutinized all those and I can easily see a lot of mistakes and preventing useful edits from being done through bad faith assumptions of guilt, similar to those you displayed towards me for criticizing your actions.

I think the United Kingdom itself maybe be emerging to be an early 21st century super power with the US as the world hyper power. Here's the reasons for me thinking this:
Second to the US in world diplomacy
Second highest defence budget
Second largest navy in terms of tonnage
Second most power projection capability
Second largest aircraft carrier fleet with second largest aircraft carries being built after the Nimitz aircraft carriers
UN Security Council seat and founding member
Head of the Commonwealth of Nations (the largest organisation of states after the UN)
The British monarch is also Head of State of 15 other countries such as Canada, Australia, and New Zealand
Major player in NATO and EU
Large North Sea oil and gas production
London being one of the greatest cities in the world 
City of London being the world's main financial centre in terms of number of amount of money that passes through it each year and largest gathering of financial groups.
Pound Sterling one of the world's top currencies alongside US Dollar and Euro
Second highest growth for major developed economies after US.
Its own nuclear missiles on nuclear submarines which have joint longest range with US nuclear submarines
Largest number of over seas territories
Carried out major invasions of Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, and Iraq. 
Was only the nation to actually invade Afghanistan and Iraq alongside US forces (Other forces came after US & UK forces had secured the countries)
Second largest force in Iraq and Afghanistan 
Leads the fight against Afghan rebels in Helmand province
Controls southern Iraq and large areas of Afghanistan
Leads NATO force in Kosovo
The leading nation in tackling global warming
A leading country in the Middle East road map to peace
Most involved in Darfur issue
Second most involved in Iran nuclear issue
Single handedly resolved Sierra Leone issue
I think since the end of the Cold War to present the United Kingdom has played the second largest role in the world after the United States, and after all the role a country plays in the world is what defines a super power. Also the United Kingdom demonstrated that it can single handedly and quickly defeat a regional power and quickly resolve a conflict when it won the Falklands War. This is more than what can be said for such countries as the United States or Former Soviet Union. After the Second World War and during the 1950s the United Kingdom was considered to be a super power because of the role it played in the world but the after effect of the Suez crisis made this disappear. The Falklands war and Thatcher-Reagen era displayed the UK was preparing to retrieve its status as being on the same level as the USA and USSR. Soon after this the Cold War ended and with no Soviet Union left to counter the United Kingdom in any way (like in the Suez crisis) the Thatcher-Reagen duo had worked and the United Kingdom set in motion activities to reclaim such a postion it had in the world that it had in the world before the Suez crisis in time for the beginning of the 21st century. The 1990s was a bit of a prelude to today and saw the United Kingdom slowly begin to prepare as being a power equal to the US and former USSR by being eager to greatly contribute to the Gulf War and and Yugoslav wars and grew more involed in Western Africa by sending troops there to resolve conflict in Sierra Leone and was testing its place as second most powerful in the world to the US and in being a semi super power again. Soon afterwards September 11th happened and the War on Terror that followed gave the United Kingdom just what it needed to reassert itself on the world stage and came just at the right time to have given the United Kingdom time to perpare and try out its future after the end of the Cold War and for the beginning of the 21st century. Today the United Kingdom is easily seen as being second most powerful on the world stage diplomatically and even militarily and could be called a semi super power. People have started to raise this issue called the British Moment in the 21st century. The United Kingdom also acts very much as a deciding force in NATO and the EU in which policy they take or their futures in whether it decides to side with the US or EU and can have an effect around the world. It also greatly influences the other 52 members of the Commonwealth of Nations which it heads by its monarch and is the largest body other than the UN. Not to mention its influence and veto power of being a permanent member of the UN Security Council.",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

The band was formed in the February 6 2008 along with Foretance by Preston Joseph, Preston formed a band in 2007 with the same members in it except Sham Bahrin after he rest off his acting career, but the band didn’t work out well, cause the band was moving really fast, and the band members still doesn’t know how to play the instruments.

Preston searched for a name in a day, the name was suppose to be name after a japanese god of destruction but it may corrupt their religion of islam. The band later posted a few novel names in the internet, and let the worldwide people vote which is the best name, there are 6 names, Mirza took Agent To The Stars (by John Scalzi), Morning Star (by Simon Raven), and more, but there are 11 votes on Agent To The Stars, which led the band to take the name.",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

While I agree that a rewrite to be more concise is a reasonable future goal, I certainly disagree that the revised sections I've prepared """"perpetuate"""" any problems; they simply don't address (and weren't designed to address) the concerns you raise. They are merely intended to correct inaccuracies, update figures, make language clearer, and verify information. I strongly object to the notion that the """"writing style is deeply flawed""""—I am always careful to write in an encyclopedic tone, with NPOV in mind. Perhaps these new versions are not perfect, but I do submit that they are an improvement. Even if this more detailed material should eventually be forked, I think what I am writing now could be the basis of that fork.

 """"no you're wrong, it's perfect acceptable. . . ."""" 

Hello,

I always welcome feedback for my efforts, most of which nowadays are editing and writing narrative nonfiction and novels.

And I do appreciate those who have studied the art and science of the English language, esp. grammar and usage. 

I especially love it when those who would criticize another's work do it decently and respectfully.

Having listened to the tone, color and texture of your message, I assume that you're not one of those I describe in paragraph two above. Further, I assume you're not diplomatic in your dealings with other people, in general. Either that, or you're just plain too lazy to be kind and decent. 

Telling me I'm """"wrong"""" is just plain rude, esp. when BOTH of us are correct, according to modern-day usage.

By the way, the correct way your sentence should've been structured is, """"No, you're wrong; it's perfectly acceptable."""" Of course, I may've said something like, """"You're both right, Dean. Happy editing and thank you for contributing to Wkipedia.""""

Of course, that's just I . . . or me, as it were. . . .

I wish you well in your future edits.

Take care,

Dean Garner

I think that it is important to mention national syndicalism at the beginning, as that eliminates a good amount of the problems with temporality associated with some of the more generalizing and overarching terms that have been suggested.
As for the left-right thing, it should be apparent that national syndicalism itself was a nationalistic movement, but the economics they embraced were not generally what would be considered """"right wing"""". I agree that it is problematic to harmonize all of the elements, but the next paragraph focuses on the right wing stuff (i.e., totalitariansm, etc.), and the third paragraph delves into the economics ideology. Neither of those is contradictory to the lead. Fascism arose during a fragmentary, transitional period, and it ideology embraced what today may seem to be contradictory elements. It's probably better to try and get that across earlywhich the reference to """"national syndicalism"""" should facilitate, than oversimplify.
Regarding the deleted material, I think there are some claims made there that would have to be sourced and attributed or based on a substantial body of text in the main article that provided context (and sourcing).

Creationism is the explanation  that the universe and all life were created by the deliberate act of God.

In looking through the historical record at the competition between creation and evolution in Darwin's day, I was impressed by Thomas Huxley's 1887 account of how Origin of Species provided the first explanation that in Huxley's view was a better explanation than creation.  Huxley describes the sense in which he rejected creation as an explanation.

If Agassiz told me that the forms of life which had successively tenanted the globe were the incarnations of successive thoughts of the Deity; and that he had wiped out one set of these embodiments by an appalling geological catastrophe as soon as His ideas took a more advanced shape, I found myself not only unable to admit the accuracy of the deductions from the facts of paleontology, upon which this astounding hypothesis was founded, but I had to confess my want of any means of testing the correctness of his explanation of them. And besides that, I could by no means see what the explanation explained. 

Huxley describes his similar rejection of the explanations of the evolutionists prior to Darwin.

And, by way of being perfectly fair, I had exactly the same answer to give to the evolutionists of 1851-8. . . . [A] thorough-going evolutionist, was Mr. Herbert Spencer, whose acquaintance I made, I think, in 1852. . . . Many and prolonged were the battles we fought on this topic. But even my friend's rare dialectic skill and copiousness of illustration could not drive me from my agnostic position. I took my stand upon two grounds: firstly, that up to that time, the evidence in favor of transmutation was wholly insufficient; and, secondly, that no suggestion respecting the causes of the transmutation assumed, which had been made, was in any way adequate to explain the phenomena. Looking back at the state of knowledge at that time, I really do not see that any other conclusion was justifiable. 

Furthermore, any self-respecting religion-neutral anthropologist, such as Robert L. Carneiro, Curator of the American Museum of Natural History, would classify creation and evolution as mere successive stages of incomplete but improving explanations in a universe where there is no God to assist the women and men who attempt to discover the truth of their origins. 

From all of the above, I suggest that it is more accurate to define creationism as an explanation rather than a belief.  After all, the survival of the belief derives from the usefulness of the belief, and a primary use of creationism is explaining how we all got here.  According to Thomas Huxley, until Origin of Species, creationism was as good an explanation as evolutionism.  And for the majority of American voters who cannot understand the evolutionists' explanations, creationism is a better explanation than evolutionism even yet today.  - 16:08, 25 Aug 2004 (UTC)

 Considering that """"Belief in the psychological sense is a representational mental state that takes the form of a propositional attitude and in the religious sense, belief refers to a part of a wider spiritual or moral foundation, generally called faith, and that creationism is part and parcel of the christian faith, I think the use of the term """"belief"""" was completely justified. Creationism is indeed an explanation, but it is an explanation founded on belief, hence it is a belief. It is not founded on knowledge or evidence; to imply otherwise, which is what you're doing, is to create a false impression that Creationism shares some sort of parity with other explanations which do not require belief in the supernatural. It does not. You seem to be substituting your own personal bias for this imputed """"evolutionist bias"""" you claim is on the Creationism page.  16:48, 25 Aug 2004 (UTC)

Hey Dirk. You gave a good answer to my question concerning the Roman tactics of bringing provinces into the Empire, and I read your similar question, and I may have an answer for you. There are a couple of major reasons as to twhy Alexander was able to take his army so far in so short a time. Alexander had the advantage of inheriting a great army from his father, and the Macedonian Empire saturated with, I believe, silver.

Another major factor was the Persians  they had a large army of hundreds of thousands, mostly conscripted agaist their will and treated very poorly. When Darius was defeated, he actually was treated like a liberator, and could have easily not only absorbed the remnants of the Persian army, but gained more volunteers.

 """"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them,"""" 

and then in Gen 2:7:

 """"then the Lord God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature,"""" 

followed by Gen 2:21:

 """"So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh. And the rib that the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man.""""

These passages contradict one another.  The first states man and woman being created together.  The second two have Adam being created first, followed by Eve.  If a person believes that the Bible is the word of God then both are correct.  So, to make them both correct there has to be a first woman followed by Eve.  Which is how the idea of Lilith came about - filling in the gaps to make both versions true.  If a person believes the Bible is the inspired word of God, written by men capable of error, there is no need for Lilith.

 Stub sorting guidelines 
I sincerely believe that we really need to lay down the law in stub sorting, and really provide a guideline.  I believe that we should all attempt to reach a general consensus by April 2, 2005 in a set of rules that we can follow.  Once we have built a set of guidelines, we can formally create a policy out of those guidelines.  We need to define what a specialized topic stub is, how many articles it should cover, when is it appropriate to create it, what defines its need for its creation, what defines its need for deletion, what criteria it should follow, what are the general steps should one take when sorting a stub, whether or not to start using subst: for all templates, whether or not use subst: for all templates created by the meta-templates, and any other matters that may come up in consideration.  I thank  for initially creating the subpage for the project at Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject Stub sorting/Guidelines.  Even though they have been discussed, I feel that we really need to confirm everything.  For that, we should discuss each issue with its own sections, and raise a list of issues that we need to nail down before really continuing on.  The English Wikipedia is nearly at 500k articles.  Either the MediaWiki software needs to handle stubs such that they can be found with a simple union of categories, or the sorting is done manually by Wikipedians.  Personally, I think the latter is less taxing on the server load, especially when we use subst:, which I think would help the Wikipedia out, performance wise.  Please make your comments at Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject Stub sorting/Guidelines.  I apologize for making this somewhat of a spam notice, but since the project has more members, the project can finally decide on these important issues at hand.  (talk) 23:23, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

That thing you did
‘’Hi Gadfium - a while back I was having trouble with some geography stubs, and (via the Village Pump) you found out for me that they'd been created twice, and fixed them. What did you do?’’
Just delete and restore the article which is appearing more than once. If that doesn't seem to work, try refreshing the category that they're in (edit the category page and then change the URL to say refresh instead of edit), and as a last resort, make a trivial change to the duplicated article to force a change to the database.  01:47, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

 changing geo-stub 

this is bordering on the absurd.  I have ended a number of my articles and stubs with Oceania-geo-stub, and someone has changed them to just plain stubs, so now I make it just a stub, and someone comes in behind me and changes it first to a geo-stub and then to an Oceania-geo-stub.  07:09, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)
Nuthin' to do with me - and anyone involved in the Stub sorting project should know to leave it as a oceania-geo-stub. Which articles do you mean? |hello? 
I don't even know precisely which articles they are anymore...most of my recent edits have had to do with the islands of French Polynesia and the Cook Islands.  I haven't bothered to look at who's changing the stubs, or if perhaps it's a problem with the db (I've had on occasion to submit several times...)   07:46, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)
The db may be the culprit. These stubs are very heavily used and the system does seem to slow down a bit with them. Not sure why that would result in the multile template changes though. As to an overhaul of the names, that would mean changing 50+ different regional stubs which between them are used on close to 10,000 articles. It's simply not practical. |hello? 
Ah.  I will look into it.  Tokelau has always been something of a side-bar interest for me, since they seem to be the """"left-out"""" islands.  I'll check out what you've written, and add anything that I think I might have to contribute.  Unfortunately for my ability to contribute to these Polynesia-related articles, Wikipedia is catching me about 15 years after my interest in the subject reached its zenith...  I ardently believe in the philosophy that drives Wikipedia, and so I'm doing whatever I can to write, edit or create appropriate articles, based mostly on memory (which is why they seem sometimes perhaps to be a bit light on citation...)...If I had a crappier memory, I'd be more hesitant about contributing... -)  Believe me tho...when I decided to move to the Marquesas, specifically, to Eïao, my decision was well-researched.

Request For Mediation In Removing Mclellan and The Marine Corps From Manookian's Page [Armenian Issues]
I have tried to informally resolve the editing issues on Arman Manookian to no avail. As a matter of fact, I requested mediation with no response. Moreover, a consensus of Assisting Editors informed me, when I tried to include Arman Manookian on the List of Historically Notable Marines, that Arman Manookian was merely a clerk and nothing more and did not warrant such inclusion and was not part of Marine Corps History. Based on that guidance, I deleted references to McClellan [a Marine Corps Historian] on Manookain's page. Now, I note, the very same editors who opined that Manookian did not warrant inclusion on the List of Historically Notable Marines, insist on including McClellan's name and the Marine Corps on Manookian's page for propaganda purposes. I have repeatedly pointed out that this type of inclusion detracts from Manookian's accomplishments independent of the United States Marine Corps History. It appears as though a double and convoluted standard applies and it is very offensive to Armenians. Moreover, 3 linked references to McClellan and the Marine Corps confuse the readers as to who really the article is about. Is it about Manookian or Mclellan or the United States Marine Corps? Although I am assuming Good Faith, several witnesses are absolutely dismayed at this type of conduct and it should be noted that it gives the appearance of Bias for a POV and propaganda. I don't believe Mediation is consistent with an Editing War. Moreover, as I stated before in assuming Good Faith, it appears as though Manookian's page is being collaborated to sell art and recruit for the Marine Corps. Yet when simple solutions are offered, such as including Manookian and McClellan on the List of Historically Notable Marines, it is ignored because his last name ends in IAN and the fact that he committed suicide as a self imposed martyr. Despite the fact that on the Editor Assistance page the question posed was not answered and then listed as answered, I followed the guidance of those editors who in essence stated that the reason Manookian was taken off the List of Historically Notable Marines was because he was a clerk and McClellan only said nice things about [his name and fame are intertwined with it [Marine Corps History]] him because he felt sorry that Manookian committed suicide and not because he had anything to do with him being the first Marine Corps historical artist/illustrator. I followed their guidance and hope you follow their guidance as well.  This type of conduct cannot stand and it will be noted or publicized. Moreover, there seems to be a concerted effort by so-called volunteer editors who have a keen eye either on my edits or on Marine Corps History that have a problem with historically notable Marines whose last names end in IAN or who volunteered for suicide missions. Apparently, it has something to do with recruitment of Armenians for Martyrdom during WWII and the Marine Corps' subsequent treacherous conduct of ignoring those very same Armenian American Marines for political and financial reasons. At this point I ask that an administrator watch this page very carefully as it relates to an Armenian American Marine who cannot defend himself from scavengers.   00:44, 10",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Hi there,  

One of my current projects is working on turning the article about Adrienne Clarkson the former Governor General of Canada into a featured article.

I think that one of the confounding issues is what to name what Einstein called """"spooky action at a distance."""" The idea of action involves the application of some force over some amount of time, and our ordinary idea of """"causing something"""" involves exerting force on some system to influence its behavior. But entanglement is exhibited without the lag that would be required were interactions at a velocity ≤ c, so something is going on that is not """"causal"""" in the usual sense. On the other hand, before one or the other entangled twin particles is measured, they both have the freedom or the potential to manifest either spin, and after one of them is measured and must manifest a spin then the other no longer has the freedom or potential to manifest any spin other than the opposite of the one that was first measured. So something has changed, and it strikes me as creating an intellectual smokescreen to say that there is only some kind of abstract """"correlation"""" involved. Like the """"collapse"""" of a wavefunction, we have no idea of what is going on or how to describe it. All we know is that it happens. It also strikes me as possibly significant that the time sequence may not be clear. From my frame of reference, electron A is observed first, and electron B is observed second. Someone else, in another frame of reference, may see electron B as being observed first and electron A as being observed second. There are also phenomena within the same frame of reference that we call retrocausal. We have no way of knowing that the discovery of the polarity of photon B at time T+n determines, retrocausally, the polarity of photon A at time T. If we say that these changes are not local, that must  (I think) mean that they are not local in space-time. So, in a sense, I end up arguing against my own discomfort with the idea that there is """"only"""" a correlation between the discovered states of any entangled twins.

d22ac35725b0a535,"""About Claim of POV and grammar errors for this article==

To: speedoflight

Your claim of POV and grammar error are not clear and not helpful. For instance, I cannot see what's wrong with the sentence: """"As a versatile actor, Cheung also acted in many comedies."""" With all the different types of roles and movies he acted, it is proper to call him a versatile actor. In addition, all the movies talked in the same paragraph are comedies. As the names of movies are already given, people can easily check out by either checking the movie itself or going to imdb or any other movie related website. Neither is there any grammar error in this short sentence. Without this sentence, the whole paragraph became confusing and ridiculous. In addition, I keep telling you that Cheung's niece never explicitly said in his funeral that Cheung was suffered from depression. This can be verified by the video record of his funeral published by Cheung's family. However, you stick on introducing this mistake again and again. In addition, Ouyang Feng's job in the movie Ashes of Time is killer agent instead of assassin, this is easy to verify as the movie's name is given in the article. I don't know why you change it to the wrong one. You also remove the movie link of Happy together. I can't see any of these revisions made by you have anything to do with POV or Grammar error.

As for the subtitle """"Golden Age in Film"""", it is just to address the blooming period of Cheung's Film career. Changing to """"Height in career"""" did not show anything about Film. If you want to change it to something else, at least you should not ruin the meaning. I can see that you are very anti-Chinese media. However, You should not bring personal feeling in editing. I can understand and am tolerant with Chinese media doesn't mean I would trust them. In fact, I am trying to dig out references not just from news media, but also books and original interviews, which make the job time consuming.

Again, it's no problem and you are definitely welcome to do editing. However, you need to be careful not introduce new mistakes in the article. In addition, please explain you point clear for others to understand and check outAugest 

I keep telling you to be patient as I am still in my process to finger out a better way to put references and resources staff. However, you keep removing things in all kinds of excuses, introducing tons of mistakes, and making the article ambiguous. If you want to put whatever references you want, go ahead and do it. Or if anything you consider as needed a reference, EXPLICITLY POINTED OUT. Don't just rudely remove things with ridiculous reasons. Not """"EVERY"""" piece of sentence needs a reference, otherwise ALL articles in wiki should be removed. I spent THREE months to verify the information, correct errors and finish the current article. To dig out all the original resources may need another 3 months. I also need break during the Christmas season. Please be patient!!! Augest 

Please don't remove background or useful information when you do """"gramma"""" corrections. Augest 

I think it's better to put Chinese version of Cheung's suicide note in his Chinese version wiki page to reduce redundancy. However, I don't have time to do it yet.

As for the references, I am still trying to think a better way to include them, as there are too much about him, please be patient. Thank you for the suggestions though! Augest

The eastern Montana thing is going to be tricky; there was a boom just like now in the 70s-80s, and a subsequent crash, the pattern is significant, not necessarily a permanent thing. Will take proper research to do that bit justice  and if anyone does a """"shoutout"""" to Sidney, but not Miles City, Glendive, Glasgow or maybe even Baker and Wibaux, (and, of course, Ekalaka!) we will be in all sorts of trouble! (grin)  Plus, at the moment, with that murder out in Sidney, the place is coming under a lot of scrutiny for the boomtown atmosphere, and so I suggest we tread delicately.  (talk) 

 Article Structure 

Okay, so there seems to be no basic consensus on how this article should be structured.  I can't find an outline in the wikiprojects sections, so I am going to attempt to make one based on the the only three states at FA-Class Minnesota, Oklahoma, and Virginia and the nearest GA-Class article, South Dakota.  Yes, we're being beaten by South Dakota.  Here is my suggestion: 

Etymology — (see OK's) — Short description of where the name Montana comes from
Geography — (see SD's) — General descriptions about size and location
Geology and terrain — Junk about east v west, mountains, rivers, etc.  Just not a bunch of lists
Flora and fauna — kind of obvious; may need to break state into regions  
Climate
Protected lands — State and national parks, I guess.
History — Summarize and send off to the History of Montana page
American Indian reservations — Brief overview and description of the Indian reservations in Montana.  Could be linked here until a separate page can be made.
Cities and Towns — (See OK's) — Briefly describe the make-up of Montana's cities and towns.  Not a giant list. There's already one here, just send people there.  Really, only those with more than 50,000 should be listed on this page, but given that doesn't even include the capital we may as well go down to Kalispell at around 20,000 (i.e. the largest seven).  No other town even has 10,000.  We're not exactly waiting up on election night for the Havre votes to come in.
Demographics — Basic census crap written in prose
Population
Ancestry
Religion
Economy
Culture — (see OK's and (VA's))
Arts and theatre — We have plenty of museums and theatres across the state.  You could list the most important ones first, but eventually they need to be put into prose.
Festivals and events — Ditto
Sports and recreation
Organized sports — Probably mostly college sports and minor league baseball.  Could add state games and skiing competitions I guess.
Outdoor recreation — hiking, fishing, mountain biking, skiing, etc.
Government and politics — (see OK's)
State government
Local government
Tribal government
National Politics
Education — School districts, administration, universities/colleges, etc.
Media — (see OK's and SD's) — Links to lists should be okay, but here only the largest and prominent should be mentioned as well as Nielsen zones, etc.
Health — (see VA's and OK's) — MT's healthcare system, stats, and perhaps main hospitals.
Transportation — (see OK's) — Basic info from the MDOT on our roads, train stations, and airports.  And, the basic health of our transportation system.
State symbols — (see VA's)

Any Comments?

05687bcb86751fc2,"""::The CTMU is not passing itself off as an """"academic"""" theory. It can't, because Langan is not a member of academia. But then again, a theory need not be academic to be notable. For example, print and television journalists and their readers and viewing audiences can deem things notable as well. Nor do academics have a monopoly on logical or factual correctness, scholarly integrity, or intellectual merit, except possibly in the well-indoctrinated minds of some academics themselves (and of course, their aspiring apprentices, whose eager anticipation of scholastic glory sometimes inflates their academic snobbery to blimpish proportions).

Byrgenwulf complains that """"we chaps"""" are not the sole arbiters of what belongs in the article. This is correct. To his credit, he invites others to tag his assertions. However, this is a bit specious, for having belatedly come to the realization that he has no relevant, verifiable assertions to make, he is now specializing in challenging the assertions of others. Thus, we now find him imperiously and rather comically demanding that every one of Langan's assertions receive a separate citation, when this is flatly unnecessary because the source material in which those assertions are made is already directly linked to the article. 

It is important for Byrgenwulf to understand that he has exactly the same burden of proof as his opponents. Not only must he provide a legitimate citation for anything he wishes to add to the article, but given that the article already links to ample source material, anything he wants to remove or qualify must be proven false, irrelevant, or non-neutral. Unfortunately, he hasn't yet been able to lock onto this signal. He still labors under the assumption that like some sort of Ultimate Bureaucrat, he can sit at his keyboard and demand an infinite amount of verification without verifying anything himself.  

By now, everyone involved in this matter has come to a stark realization: neither Byrgenwulf, nor any of his tiny but dedicated band of confederates, HAS any citations or other sources of verification for their own accusations. They are merely using the article, which is faithful to the material it cites, to prosecute their philosophical bias against its topic, the CTMU, which was deemed notable and newsworthy by several international periodicals and news networks. They do not like what the CTMU says; the article on the CTMU reports on what the CTMU says, and what Langan and the press say about the CTMU; hence, they do not like the article on the CTMU. 

This conflation of the article with the theory is reflected in Byrgenwulf's transparent strategy of attacking the theory through the article, attempting to dispose of the message by killing the messenger. Meanwhile, he seemingly fails to register the fact that he is himself in glaring violation of Wikipedia verifiability policy, and that his all-too-evident editorial bias is in massive violation of NPOV as well. Oozing contempt, Byrgenwulf has rumbled into the middle of the CTMU article with a load of summary demands, snide remarks, and self-righteous, factually worthless criticism...but not one relevant citation in hand! Nothing he says is verifiable; as we have now repeatedly seen, he cannot even be trusted on matters in which he claims to be an expert. This makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to take his demands seriously.

Sophie Calle is a disturbing character. Artist known as """"unclassable"""", its autobiographical works cause polemic. It is a photographer but almost never its photographs itself takes, it makes its life a work of art by using the others, and spaces it few days becomes a character of novel. Its most known series of photographs is that of the """"Blind men"""". By always combining the text and the image, it photographs blind men of birth and their request to express their vision of the beauty.  With the limit of the indiscretion, Sophie Calle often takes risks to work out her settings in scene. She follows people in the street to photograph them, she posed as a maid in a Venetian hotel to inspect and photograph the personal effects of customers. Works of Sophie Calle are diverse. The context in which the texts and photographs fit makes it possible to often qualify them """"artistic performance"""". The public is often shocked by Calle's works. Along with primary shock and disapproval, morals are often mandated to be discarded in appreciating the innovating works of Sophie Calle.

Judging from its terrible grammar, syntax and diction (and use of """"its"""" where """"her"""" should be, for example), this seems to be a machine translation from an unreferenced French source. Furthermore, statements such as the paragraph's initial sentence are ubsubstatiated and biased, and thus not encyclopaedic.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

The Maghreb had far greater proven wealth than the unknown rest of Africa and a location of strategic importance affecting the exit from the Mediterranean. For the first time, Morocco became a state of some interest in itself to the European Powers. France showed a strong interest in Morocco as early as 1830.

Ms. Barber said: """"They are making claims about 'registering' these dogs ... yet if you actually researched their web sites, they are only using AKC dogs, and mixing them with what they claim to be Shilohs!!  Why??  It's just a money game!  If they can print off a paper that says the pup is a Shiloh, they get more money for that pup!""""

Ms. Barber said: """"Well, to start with, there are """"recognized"""" registries, like the AKC, CKC, UKC, SV, UK and various other breed club registries recognized under the FCI.""""

Ms. Barber said: """"Then there are the 'self' proclaimed """"registries"""" that will issue a piece of paper to anyone that sends them some cash!  They are a BIG joke in the """"official"""" dog world, and there is a lot of Internet verification regarding all of them!!""""

Ms. Barber said: """"I am sure that the TSSR, NSBR, SSBA, etc. have convinced themselves that they *are* registries, but I can also assure you that no other legitimate organization, like the UKC .. AKC .. FCI .. etc. would agree with them!! Just because someone says something (and it's not illegal) that does not *make* it so!!"""" 

Jareth: (see above) Ms. Barber has repeatedly and continuously made personal attacks about other registries and should be banned by you for doing so.  She should be subject to the same rules/restrictions to which the other contributors to this discussion have been held. Wiki has not allowed others to address Ms. Barber's questionable registry/club/breeding practices, so why is she being allowed to continue to do so? 

And, despite being the """"first"""" registry, what independent, unbiased documentation has the ISSR provided to show that they are any """"different"""" or more """"recognized"""" than any other Shiloh registry, when it comes to accreditation by any outside organization. The fact of the matter is, the ISSR is no more """"recognized"""" independently than any of the other Shiloh registries currently in operation.

Also, like the 'self' proclaimed registries Ms. Barber references, the ISSR also issues its own """"pieces of paper"""" based on Ms. Barber's own determination and her registry charge for these """"pieces of paper"""".  What Ms. Barber is claiming about other registries (""""Just because someone says something [and it's not illegal] that does not *make* it so!!""""), is true of her own, as she has repeatedly throughout this discussion failed to provide unbiased, independent (as you stipulated as a rule for the inclusion of information or contribution) corroboration that her organization is any different.

In addition, the article, as now changed again, with Ms. Barber's numerous links to her own registry's/club's website are again both self-promoting and an attempt to steer readers to her business and to hinder Wikipedia's policy of """"neutrality"""" in its articles.  These links are not unbiased, factual, neutral information.  Readers wishing to pursue more information re: her club/registry have the link at the bottom of the article (along with the other registry/club links) they can access if they want to hear more from her.

At this stage, I think it is obvious that Ms. Barber has no intention of negotiating and compromising, in good faith and mutual respect, a """"neutral"""", factual, independent, unbiased article.

Films

Hi Nehrams hope your studies are going well and are off on vacation. First have you ever considered some new parameters to the film template -including genre, art direction, casting, second unit director, costume design for example. Also do you think its worth setting up a branch of film WPFilms/Westerns to conentrate on improving western film articles -I know a number of members who would be interested. 

You'll be pleased to know I have created two new templates for film images  these include  Template:Filmrationale  (for screenshots and posters)  and Template:Filmbiorationale (for all deceased film people). I regularly upload many images and it is SOOO! much easier. It has been long awaited and already many users are beginning to use them. For normal bios use Template:Biorationale

I have noticed a crackdown on images to the point that it is seriously affectig our articles, For instance Cinema of the UNited States looks ridiculous with no images. Surely there is even an image of CHarlie Chaplin which is publuic domain? I really hope our images will remain including our main film reel icons which were supposed to be deleted July 1.

I have begun an enormous task of compiling the list of American films in which I have asked the project to help out. Any contribution even if it is adding one or two details particularly 1960-present is really needed.

The editor who fears that the inclusion of facts about Oswald's claim of being made a patsy by the use of fabricated evidence and then being silenced by murder, has received support from another editor by the name of  Mr. Harris. (See, above) Mr. Harris argues the beliefs there was a plot to kill the president, and that Oswald was set up, is similar to believing the earth is flat. 

No Mr. Harris, you are out of step with the modern world. In 1979, a Congressional Committee engaged in a three year study and determined that Kennedy was probably murdered as a result of a conspiracy, and in 2003 only 22% of Americans agree with you. Mr. Harris, you are clinging to the past in the face of overwhelming information to the contrary that is slowly being made public as more and more documents are declassified.  Sometimes one has to question old beliefsnot try to delete facts from books that disprove ones old beliefs. 

Congress enacted federal legislation in 1992 to open up the mass of secret government records about the assassination. The Assassination Records Review Board points out that not many people agree with Mr. Harris:

""""The American public has expressed its dissatisfaction with both the work and the conclusions of the official investigations of the assassination and it was this dissatisfaction that was primarily responsible for Congress' initiative to establish the Assassination Records Review Board (Review Board). Section 3(2) of the JFK Act defines the records of each of these official investigative entities as assassination records. As such, the Review Board worked to review and release all records that these investigative entities used in reaching their conclusions about the assassination.""""

Mr. Harris it won't help you cause to argue that everyone but you is dumb, a """"flat-earth believer"""", or must be sheltered from the facts. Please, just stop deleting facts from the articles. The old viewpoint that you want to believe is in the article. But, you’re not
satisfied. You want to keep out the evidence that makes your position to look improbable, but the web site rules forbid you deleting such information.

 Atomic Attacks on Japan 

I'm not sure this section is a good example of revisionism. The reason is, the """"old"""" view is still widely held and valid, the US certainly did drop the bomb to end the war quickly - it may have also had other motivations, which are now coming to light, which adds to a more nuanced picture of events. There will always be new perspectives and theories, just like in Decline of the Roman Empire, but these are not really revisionistic. Revisionism, strictly speaking, is where you take an established idea and discount it based on new evidence.  Otherwise it is just the normal process of better understanding the many nuances and complexity of history. So I guess the question is, is there a school of thought saying the US did not drop the bomb because it wanted to end the war early?   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

this article was the sum  of many peoples input , effort and hard work  so i dont know how or who removed it so thoughtlessly and put the meaningless redirect to the clairvoyance page... any help would be great.... cheers.. 

hi guys

i see youve redirected  the clairsentience article.... let me ask....what was the point of the weeks of discussions and rewrites if you guys were going to redirect it anyway....you should have told me t get lost out of here...... what was the point of it all?  why did i listen to you ? at all?  why did i remove all personal references?  why did i reference and source all of my matereal diligently and in great detail ?  why did i edit and re edit for style and content ?  why did i make additional references to religios , anthropological ,socialogical , philosophical ,medical , physics , chemistry , botany , mental health etc  so that all views were included and respected?  why did i fulfill all of the above hurdles and hoops to fulfill wikpedia formatting and guidlines for you too to delete months of hard work and effort.  your actions are without integrity or honour .....

Hi ..... whoever removed the clairsentience article and made it redirect ... can you please try and respect that the article that was there had evolved over a couple of months of discussion and many rewrites and multiple edits which involved much discussion over a long period......
.........i could delete this clairvoyance article.... but i wont because revert and delete wars then stupidly take place   which is a real shame when a library becomes a bar room brawl......

 Borisoglebsk 2 

After testing of the new Russian """"anti-high-tech"""" Borisoglebsk 2 in Ukraine, this new Russian weapon system appears to jam all communication as well as GPS-system. Hence a question about all other """"high-tech"""" weapon rises. This has suddenly frightened American military as well as NATO. According to (a right wing) Swedish morning newspaper, with good international reputation.
I can't see what was undue in my contibution. Can America just take it for granted that F-35 can't be stopped by Borisoglebsk 2 ? It doesn't seem so to me. OK it's early days still, but fact is neither the American Airforce or NATO know if the Borisoglebsk 2 system will make the F-35 inoperable. But EMP pulses from huge nuclear detornations and from the sun is no news. Neither is jamming. I think all possible counter weapons belongs to the weapon article. (Also if/when an anti-Borisoglebsk 2 weapon is invented.) 
Generally ,if the best assult weapon can be made inoperable by a even better defence system, such matters goes together. And it's not I who ask whether the F-35 stands up towards the Borisoglebsk 2, according to the source, ist it NATO and America who wonders. (Presumably Russia as well)   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

The page is already protected. Is this a request for unprotection?  
Yes, please unprotect this page.  
Sorry, but in spite of your efforts I don't think the discussion has reached enough of a resolution right now to avoid a resumption of the revert war as soon as the page is unprotected.  
Veriverily only chooses to lodge personal attacks against me as long as he manages to censor any facts that he feels might reflect negatively on the U.S. by means of a page protection. There cannot be a discussion unless the page protection is lifted. If we have to wait for Veriverily, the page might as well be protected permanently.  
Refer to the large number of people who have put effort into this article - Ed Poor, Cadr, Cantus, Eloquence - while 172 seeks to sabotage our efforts at working together and impose his own agenda.  The Talk pages are available, so one can see 172 is lying.  Although I have aired my frustration with 172 several times there, the issues have also been much discussed by me and others (i.e., """"only"""" yeah right).  As Cadr said on this very page ,  """"Agree with VV. A lot of constructive work was being done on the page; the problems are almost enitrely down to the user he mentions."""" (in ref to 172)  As soon as the protection is off, 172 will continue his activities.  V

Unprotect Augusto Pinochet. Cadr and Veriverily refuse to back down one inch, and no one else seems to be paying any attention. Is this page just going to be protected indefinitely?  

See brief discussion below and, for the patient, that at Talk:Augusto Pinochet.  It tells a very different story. - V 
To summarize, it is 172 who refuses to budge and alter one word of the intro he wrote.  All other parties have written several draft intros each to try to accommodate objections and concerns.  172 dismisses these efforts as """"partisan bickering"""" and """"bullshit"""". - V 
Veriverily's comments are misleading at best. """"All other parties,"""" according to Veriverily, are the users (Cadr, EdPoor, AstroNomer, and himself) voting in the minority in the most recent round of polling. His preferred version does not have a """"consensus"""" behind it. This was really the winning position in the poll: """"Yes, it should be asserted, in both the intro paragraph and the CIA role in coup section, and not marked as controversial.""""  
Consensus had been reached before 172 started trolling; the poll was started afterwards and brought in random buddies of 172.  The poll voters he cites consist mostly of users who had no role in editing or contributing to the page and visibly no understanding of the issues and were voting ideologically.  Even so, the margin was only 8-5, far from overpowering.  Furthermore, one does not vote on whether to be neutral. - V 

I wasn't  """"brought in"""" to vote. Nor was I voting """"ideologically"""", rather my vote was determined by my familiarity with the issues. Perhaps instead of attacking anyone who voted differently from him V V should present more compelling arguments  

Who am I attacking?  And saying I """"should present more compelling arguments"""" supports my supposition that you were not aware of the talk of these issues, because if so you would have seen the thousands and thousands of words arguing these very points. - V 

I wasn't  """"brought in"""" to vote, I wasn't voting """"ideologically"""" and I have made (minor) contributions to the article.
 

Regardless of who the poll may have """"brought in"""", I think part of the purpose of listing this page at Wikipedia:Requests for comment, where it has appeared quite regularly for a while, is to """"bring in"""" opinions from members of the community.

It merely has the cloak of redundant information i.e. which was already posted earlier by Legalese in another section, and its main aim (as the title itself suggests) is to lecture me about what he percieves is """"civility"""". On this, Legalese definitely deserves a warning .

Again, I may repeat that I have dealt with utmost consternation AND with due respect (while mentioning the Hon'ble SC) my opinion on the judgement which may qualify as Contempt of Courtsomething which Legalese has not and probably does not even bother to looking on the Talk-page. The purpose of repeatedly levelling baseless charges of Contempt of Court, despite my clarification on the same in the talk-page earlier is beyond my comprehension.

The charge that I am not being a """"good"""" editor can only be levelled as a matter of opinion only, (which I too can leve back at him) and not as a complaint because Legalese is NOT an admin, has no authority, has had no authority on wikipedia on matters related to the judgement of the quality of articles, and even final arbitration on what constitutes as """"good editing"""" or """"Objectionable behaviour"""".

His lecture to me on civility (that too publicly on a talk-page and not on my user:page) is itself very appaling to me-who has been contributing to wikipedia since more than a year now. What is even more appaling is his assumption of a role as the Moral Guardian and as someone who discerns the quality of edits. For attempting to accuse me of AND impose the norms of """"civility"""" and that too incongruous on a talk-page of an article and not personally on my own talk-page, Legalese deserves a warning.

Besides, I never said that I find the """"word-war"""" offending to me on part of Legalese. So an Unconditional Apology on my part does not arise at all. """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

 THF 

I have not perused Wikipedia lately, but when I did, I saw some cooler (and sane) heads have seemingly prevailed, including yours.

THF was the first AEI director I had the misfortune to encounter.  When he saw my edits, which he didn't like, he came after me with a vengeance, and lobbied for me to be banned on Wikipedia.  He defamed me on his talk site (yes, I am aware of the meaning of the word, since I also am an attorney).   It was defamation - libel, to be exact -  and removed after a time, when I threatened suit.  I know Wiki doesn't like that - but it reaps what it sows.    THF  threatened me and my husband with frivolous litigation OUTSIDE of Wikipedia, and we called him on it.  We never heard from him again.
At that time, Wiki cliques would not or could not listen to what I had to say, and what had occurred.  I have no idea if I am """"banned"""" or not, and don't care at this point.  After the Kafkaesque experience, I never want to edit again here.  That said, I am grateful that you and it appears some others were able to expose him for what he is - even if it took a different issue entirely.  (I had no particular interest in the Michael Moore debate).

The AEI is one of the most powerful political influences in the Republican party.    THF was quite an eye-opener for me.  Rarely have I ever seen anyone so ruthlessly disparage others, with false """"information"""".  I can only guess what he does """"professionally"""".   THF is a public figure.  His attempt to hide out at Wikipedia claiming it was only a """"hobby"""" was laughable.  It was astonishing that anyone fell for it, but many did.

Good for you for calling him on it.  Maybe there is hope for Wikipedia, but I'm not holding my breath.""",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

2c84a0cf5cb7acd6,""":Hi. Lots of points, I'll reply as best I can:
Listing the squadrons and their aircraft types is too much /for this article/ but not too much for Wikipedia. Only listing the serial numbers, pilots or other minutiae is too much for Wikipedia. One way you could try would be to create a """"sandbox"""" page for yourself, say User:FFA P-16/Sandbox, write up the squadrons as best you can and then ask at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Aircraft‎ if we can look at it, tidy up the English, etc. and advise on the best page to put it on. Ground instruction airframes are not notable unless there is some special reason, for example if the airframe itself is notable from earlier in its life. 
Re. the ordering of the list, I would have to think about that but it is really a separate discussion. 
You say that the serial numbering (tail numbering) uses a special system. I would like to see this system explained, but it needs just a few examples to show the principles, not the whole list.
If Swiss writers routinely quote the serial number of an aircraft when writing about it, as a way of showing the information contained in the number, then you should be able to reference this. Such references might convince us that the Swiss Air Force is an exception to the general rule. We Wikipedia editors do like to see hard evidence, not just another editor's word. And, as you have noticed, we sadly know little of the Swiss Air Force unless someone can find reliable sources for us. — Cheers,  (Talk)
