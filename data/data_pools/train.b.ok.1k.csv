About your """"border skirmishes"""" and """"possibility of a ground intervention"""": I never spoke about that. When there already was a Saudi-led invasion taking place, you could not argue the way you are doing anyway. I even did not speak about """"Yemeni Fighters Trained in Persian Gulf"""" or something like that. I'm generally talking about the whole Saudi-led intervention (or: """"intervention phase of the 2015 Yemeni conflict"""") in historic sense with all its features.
Yes """"slowly"""" I got it, that you just don't use the meaning of the term """"military intervention"""" correctly. This term doesn't mean just the operations performed by one side (maybe you are changing Wikipedia encyclopedia with a military gazette?), but it addresses to a form of international conflict. Military intervention is """"Interference by a state in another’s affairs"""" by military means. That means that both - the operations of the intervening powers and the domestic operations are intermingled. Anyway there are domestic reactions to the intervention. And you'll find no historic literature, that tries to separate them, because exactly this is the character of an intervention. Every singly source dealing with the military intervention in Yemen 2015 deals with both, the foreign intervention operation and the existing ground fightings of the domestic conflict. Still you did not provide a single source that claims, they do not belong together. It is your"""""""" to treat them as separate topics and historic events. Greetings,  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

I thought that bit was the most agreeable part. All kidding aside: People who would lose all respect for someone else based on one outburst deserve no respect themselves in turn (i.e. """"outburst"""" doesn't include going on an RL killling spree or the like of course). I'm still that same guy, sometimes full of shit (includes humor), sometimes with some or even much professional attitude. Maybe I needed it. Maybe not. I like to think that I had to get out some things. And since I'm not the least bit interested in joining WR or another of those places, I had to do it here. And instead of doing it latently, I now got all that out of my system in one outburst. You see, when I usually comment e.g. on what I perceive as a bad-faith RfA oppose, I was constantly holding back, trying to stick to the rules (most of the time anyway). But that sticking to the rules is a rotten """"primary directive"""", and calling spade spade is even more necessary, because it's simply more accurate. And to do it in the form of an alc-induced (or rather, triggered) outburst affords a good option for everyone to ignore the content of what I said, as opposed to constantly complaining about this editor or that comment.

On the other hand: The way things turned out on my initial (very civil, let's not forget that!) posting to AN/I was yet another clear message of how cronyism rules the upper echelons. — Dorftrottel⁠ """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Andrew, I was in two minds about including AD. The only reason to include it was because people are unused to three digit years. At least I am! ;) Anyway, I'm happy to see it go. I love simplicity, just won't surrender it unless clarity isn't thrown out with the bathwater. As I said, I'm content. Explaining the """"nearest 50 years"""" rule is great. )
Also, I was going to explain the contents were only as specific as chapter. You have done this in a very neat and clear way, thank you! Great to have you at work on things!
Yes, I thought about linking the books or not. The main argument against was that it took so long to enter them! However, the point of linking every repeated entry in a sortable list imo is that people may sort on city, for example, to see manuscripts near their home, say. If they see that Thessalonians is in a university library 125 miles away, maybe they will click on the link to Thess to see what Wiki editors have said about the book. Instead of looking for the first instance of Thessalonians in the table, or trying to decipher the abbreviation they just click on the field in the record they are looking at.
I agree about not over-Wiki-ing, especially in the body of an article, and especially if different words are given the same link. Tables, by their nature are speedy reference systems, I like the idea of giving people just one click to follow up locating a record of interest.
One example of how I might use the table is to add a """"Textual criticism"""" section to articles on NT books that don't have one already. I'd sort the table by the Contents field (I know it's not perfect), view the data relevant to a book and click through to it.
Another use is to check just what 1 Corinthians chapters 10-11 contain. That article actually has links to specific chapters. Some of us know what's in chapters, most won't. Though, admittedly, not all articles on NT books go to specifics on chapters, but maybe in time they will.
Now the work is done, it seems like a pity to lose it. Rest assured, I'm not going to be writing articles with every second word Wikified. ;)  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Ethnic Violence
I think the following paragraph should be removed from the article -

It has been suggested that the random violence was a delayed response to crime perpetrated by other middle easterners, such as gang rapes that occured in 2000 and 2002.

My main problem with it is that the claim being put forward is totally unsourced and unsupported. Yes, whoever put it in has provided an article from the Australian as a source. However, if you actually read this article, it doesn't say anything of the sort about the violence being some kind of delayed response to events in 2000 and 2002. In fact, it only mentions rape once. Here is the relevant section of the article -

In an article on this page nearly two years ago (""""Don't turn a blind eye to terror in our midst,"""" January 12, 2004), I argued that the increasing frequency of racially motivated attacks on young Australian men and women - including murders, gang rapes and serious assaults by young men of Lebanese Muslim descent - would rise dramatically throughout Australia. These problems remain widespread and have been documented in the ensuing two years.

 Been a while. 

Happy belated: birthday, Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, and Groundhog Day.

Take a break from all the WP nannying. Hope you're doing great @ MIT.

Take another look at December 2008’s and last month’s archived portal pages and see if they work correctly on your end. Shades of Extreme Home Makeover - etc.

This may be the closest I get to re-mastering old films, like they now have to do for Blu-Ray. Feels like it, fun but tedious.

Some of these archived portal pages I've trundled through going back to Jan of '08 (so far) succumb to table-formatting bugs (on my platform [Tiger/Safari (+FF3)]). So I kludged the position of the calendars. But these two months work fine. No clue as to why they break. Is there a documented bug? This seems to be some kind of CSS error.

The Portal:Current events/How to archive the portal page must not be visited very often of late, so I'm attempting to make its link more prominent by adding a comment above the """"fold"""". Don't have a clue how many editors might contribute to the upkeep of this, though.

Here are handy linx for you to peruse these pages, only the last 2 have reconstructed sidebars As Of This Writing (hereinafter """"AOTW""""):

January 2008 (works okay on my plat)

February 2008 (broken, so it's kludged)

March 2008 (okay)

April 2008 (okay)

May 2008 (works okay, International hols are an embarrassment [why just May?])

June 2008 (works OK)

July 2008 (breaks with prescribed table formatting, so it's kludged)

August 2008 (OK)

September 2008 (OK)

October 2008 (OK)

November 2008 (also breaks so it's kludged. Don't know what'll happen if we attempt to reconstruct & restore a local [temporally speaking ;)] sidebar)

December 2008 (Okay and complete, with the important comment that it's an archived section)

January 2009 (Also OK, as above)

So pass the word along that some spadework has been done, and it's as self-explanatory as I can manage to make it. Thanx again for all the great work on this design, unjustly neglected.

Now to wake up our 2.5-year-old. Yes, it's been a while.

WikiProject Poland Newsletter • January 2014 • Issue IIFor our freedom and yours

Welcome to the second issue of WikiProject Poland newsletter, the Monitor (named after the first Polish newspaper).

Our Project has been operational since 1 June, 2005, and also serves as the Poland-related Wikipedia notice board. I highly recommend watchlisting the Wikipedia:WikiProject Poland page, so you can be aware of the ongoing discussions. We hope you will join us in them, if you haven't done so already! Unlike many other WikiProjects, we are quite active; we get close to a hundred discussion threads each year and we do a pretty good job at answering all issues raised. Last year we were featured in the Signpost, and our interviewer was amazed at our activity. In the end, however, even as active as we are, we are just a tiny group - you can easily become one of our core members!

In addition to a lively encyclopedic, Poland-related, English-language discussion forum, we have numerous useful tools that can be of use to you - and that you could help us maintain and develop:
 we have an active assessment department. As of now, our project has tagged almost 83,000 pages as Poland-related - that's an improvement of over 3,000 new pages since the last newsletter. Out of which 30 still need a quality assessment, and 2,000, importance assessment. We have done a lot to clear the backlog here (3 years ago those numbers were 1,500 and 20,000, respectively). Can you help assess a few pages?
assessing articles is as easy as filling in the class= and importance= parameters on the talk page in the {{WPPOLAND|class=|importance=}} template. See here for a how-to guide.
 once an article has an assessment template, it will appear in our article alerts and news feed, which provides information on which Poland-related articles are considered for deletion, move, or are undergoing a Good or Featured review. Watchlisting that feed, in addition to watchlisting our project's main page, is a good way to make sure you stay up to date on most Poland-related discussions.
 you can also see detailed deletion discussions at Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletion sorting/Poland (which is a good place to watchlist if you just want to stay up to date on possible deletions of Poland-related content)
 we have also begun B-class quality reviews on our talk page, and if our activity increases, hopefully we will be able to institute our own A-class quality reviews. As of now, we have about 500 C-class articles in need of a B-class review. If you'd like to help with them, instructions for doing B-class reviews are to be found in point 10 of our assessment FAQ.

When you found out about who I was, you teased me, insulted me behind my back and through e-mail, etc., etc., which is why I have become so angered with the community. Is this really necessary? Yes, you are certainly allowed to do whatever you want but some comments just pushed my buttons, which is why from time to time I exhibited infinite and random stupidity. Of course I am going to admit this — because I did. No, an arbitration will not be necessary because I am leaving the second We Belong Together finishes FAC and this is not a lie. Will I return? Maybe. I am not going to be present throughout late June–late September (I'll be studying elsewhere in the world). Therefore, I will not be making edits on Wikipedia during this time. However, following September, I might come back. Just do me this one favour: if you find out who I am (if I return), please don't tease me and do the things you have done; that was why I became uncivil and angered. Again, if you find out, just leave me to be and we wouldn't have to get caught up in such a fiasco. I really do wish you well. Seriously.

Why exactly does each image that she uploaded onto the website have to be displayed and not the ones with actual and very strong fair use rationale?

HOWEVER, if instead, I read the policy and apply the evidence to the policy, the question comes up: """"Is it disputed?"""".  The poll indicates that it is disputed.  That is how the information in the poll is used.  It is completely inadequate to determine if, in fact, waterboarding is torture, or if wikipedia should say one thing or the other. But it is NOT inadequate to determining if there is a dispute, which is a key means of checking for NPOV.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

53dbaeb616eac9c2,"Chokhor Rinpoche 
 A brief biography of fourth Chokhor Tenzin Chogyal 

Chokhor Rinpoche was born to father Kalsang Dorjee and mother Kalsang Chokey on 20th Oct, 1979 (the day was on auspicious day of Dipawali) in Kalimpong, the hill station of West Bengal, North East state of India. 

While Ripoche’s mother was pregnant, there were so many auspicious signs showed to her. She often dreamt of a white rabbit sleeping on her lap; thousand of twinkling stars entering to her womb and became different jewels. She also often dreamt a huge and well built guy with fire on his body almost look like Vajrapani was appeared and talked to her without any frightening. She also dreamt a white clothed young guy came and told her to go with him on riding dragon and hovered in the sky several times. And often that guy comes in her dream and told to keep that white rabbit and feed well. On the forth night of Rinpoche’s birthday, she dreamt same. After gave birth of of Rinpoche, Dhardo Rinpoche named him “Lhundub”.

After a year, the little Lhundub used to do pray in front of the photo of His Holiness with the decoration different fruits as offering. He also used to sit on piled pillows and saying he is Lama and take his blessing, to his relative children. Moreover, the little boy was happy to visit monastery and meet monks.

When the little boy was on four years old, he often told his dream to his parent that he dreamt of a lord of charnel grounds [having the form of a skeleton] telling him that your home is not a place of long term living, you need to go far distance where there is huge temple, and you should go with two person who would come to invite you. Rinpoche still remember that dream he told to his mother several times.

In the beginning of year 1983, the little boy started to go English School in Kalimpong. In the winter of that year, the boy Rinpoche and his parents and grandparents visited to Bodhagaya, where he got the full discourse of Shantideva’s Bodhisatvacharyavatara from His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama. While in Bodhgaya, Rinpoche’s parents were visited Pangnang Rinpoche whom they asked soothing of little boy’s well beings. Pangnang Rinpoche, after drawing of dice for soothing told that nothing to worry and added name “Tsondue” after his name “Lhundup”. There after the little boy was called “Lhundub Tsondue”.

While little boy, Lhundub Tsondue was on his routine to Nursery school, on 21st March, 1985, he was recognized as the unmistaken reincarnation of 3rd Chokhor Rinpoche by His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama. After two years later his admittance to Lhopa Khangtsen in Sera Jey Monastic University in south India, the eight-year-old Lhundub Tsondue was invited by Geshe Jampa Topgyal and Geshe Gyaltsen of Lhopa Khangtsen in 1986. The first hair cutting ceremony was taken by Sera Jey Khensur Ngawang Legden and given name as “Ngawang Choekyi Gyaltsen” and admitted to the monastery.

Few days after his admission to the monastery, Geshe Jampa Topgyal taught few alphabets to read as dependent-arising. Then Geshe Gyaltsen took Rinpoche to consult Geshe Ngawang Choesang of Tsangpa Khangtsen as a teacher. On Geshe Ngawang la’s guidance of long fifteen years, Rinpoche learned from the beginning of reading and writing, Tibetan Calligraphy, Sumchupa and Tagjug, Tibetan literature. During the consultation of Geshe Ngawang la, Rinpoche memorized all daily prayers and the root text of (Abhisamaya Alamkara, Madhyamikavatara, Abhi Dharma Khosh).Recited hundred thousand of “Tendrel Toepa”,(Praise of Dependent Arising, by Tsongkhapa). While consulting Geshe Ngawang Choesang, Rinpoche also went to Sera Je Secondary School for five years. 

In 1988, during the Lamrim teaching by His Holiness the Dalai Lama, Chokhor Rinpoche got the first privately audience with His Holiness the Dalai Lama at Drepung monastery. His Holiness gave him name “Tenzin Chogyal“.

In 1992, Chokhor Rinpoche left the academic studies and joined the monastic education with consultation of Gyume Khensur Lobsang Delek as teacher. In 1994, Rinpoche took novice vow from His Eminence Choden Rinpoche and added name “Palsangpo” after “Tenzin Chogyal” as novice name.

As the rule and regulation of the monastery, in 1996, 25th day of 6th month Rinpoche was stood on the Rigchung ceremony in the congregation of Sera Jey monks, everyone was surprised with his under/over tone of explanation with melancholic tune and answering of debate opponent.

While studying the fundamental philosophy in the monastery, on the two month vacation, Chokhor Rinpoche used to accomplish the recitation of Mig-tsema and some vocation took complete retreat on Yamantaka and had its burnt sacrifices. In 1999 Rinpoche was invited to Italy by his sponsor during the vacation, Rinpoche taught and gave lecture on Tibetan issue to Italian",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Oversourcing
Hi, I thought I should explain why I reverted the edit you made to Warwick Castle, especially considering it takes a lot less effort to hit the revert button than it does to go through and prune references. I understand that you were consolidating references since just one is used for most paragraphs. However, per WP:V """"material challenged or likely to be challenged, and all quotations, must be attributed"""". Therefore I think it's better to have a generous amount rather than just one per paragraph. Moreover, if someone was to add information to the article from another source it could wrongly appear that all the information in the paragraph before the reference comes from the new source (unless of course the editor was careful to duplicate sources). So I am sorry to revert your changes, but I am quite happy to discuss it if you still believe the references should be trimmed.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

The problem we have at the moment is that the entire section needs sourcingand while I have sources for some of it, many of these are not sources I will link to in a wiki article.  The alumni sites for example are run very well and would certainly meet sourcing requirements, but also have individuals personal information on them and I'm strongly against linking to those as sources, especially as the new website does not provide links to the alumni pages, but let's alumni voluntarily provide information about themselves.

Fusion-Mutiny

The Fusion and Mutiny played more games than are listed on this page.  Their rivalry lasted from 1998-2001.   

 Rowdies vs Miami Toros? 

Any thought to expanding this rivalry to include its pre-history, the 1975 and 1976 NASL Seasons when the Rowdies played against the Miami Toros, who would become the the Strikers? If we are including MLS matches, this notion would also seem logical to me. Cheers to all! -  

Original research
I know there's been a lot of earnest work here, but the premise appears to be entirely original research. It combines information and scores for every team from the two metropolitan areas, whether there was any real connection or not. The original Tampa Bay Rowdies were not related to the Tampa Bay Mutiny or the modern Tampa Bay Rowdies/FC Tampa Bay. The original Fort Lauderdale Strikers/Miami Toros were not related to the second Fort Lauderdale Strikers, the Miami Fusion, or the third Fort Lauderdale Strikers/Miami FC. And of course several of those were named for or played in Miami rather than Fort Lauderdale. I doubt that any source outside of Wikipedia has ever pulled them all together like this. Most of the sources used here are either self-published blogs, or they just give information on individual teams or games; they don't make a claim about an overall rivalry lasting since the 1970s. Unfortunately, this article may need a total reshifting in focus to keep it. t/c 

Allow me to address your areas of concern about this page:

THE EARLY YEARS: 1975–1993: Perhaps you did NOT read the newspaper accounts cited in this page of the very first meeting between the original clubs in 1975? Four minutes into the match and the players began to brawl! Yup, no rivalry, that. The Toros moved to Ft. Lauderdale in 1977, so from 1975–83, it was always the same two teams playing. The original Rowdies lasted until 1993 and all of the subsequent Striker teams in that era had numerous NASL-era Strikers playing for them. That is part of what carried the rivalry on during those lean ASL/APSL years. The other cited references span the years right up to the two franchises that play under the names Rowdies and Strikers in the NASL of today. Many were published by the local media in the two markets, some were done by the MLS and some by the new NASL. Are these not varied and reliable enough for your tastes? Or are you suggesting that every single article on the rivalry topic over the past 38 years needs to be cited to prove a rivalry existed and continues to exist? 

BLOGS AS A SOURCE: A quick count of the sourcing shows 37 of the 91 cited sources are from blogs, etc. Even by the broadest of definitions (i.e. 50% + 1), this is not """"most of the sources"""" as you state. It would be more accurate to say many of those blog citations are used only to verify final scores or attendance figures. Again are you suggesting that every np article on every match be unearthed to confirm the scores? Until the USSF sees fit to publish the recap of every sanctioned match in US history online, resources will remain a hodge-podge. Nearly all of the narrative of the page in question is supported by information published by reliable media outlets. Closer examination will further show that even some of the blog sourced material happens to be previously published np photos and/or articles that were scanned and posted in the blogs.

MLS era: In the MLS years, the Mutiny had several former Rowdies working in their front office staff, one of whom, by the way now happen to work for the current Rowdies. Both they and the Fusion had former NASL-era Rowdies and Strikers as their head coaches at one time or another. The Miami Ultras were originally the Fusion's supporters. They now follow the Strikers. The connections were always there. As a matter of fact, inclusion of the Mutiny/Fusion era",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

 Proper use 

The adjustable spanner#Proper use section of this article still seems to be self-contradictory.

I found one discussion  that has some physics-based arguments that I found pretty persuasive.
One commenter says that the preferred way to use a pipe wrench is the opposite direction from the preferred way to use an adjustable wrench,
which may explain why so many people disagree on the """"proper"""" direction to turn it.

Norm Abram, in """"Adjustable Wrench"""",
implies that (unlike a basin wrench) an adjustable wrench often works adequately even when turned the """"wrong way"""", such as when doing the """"flip trick"""".
This may also contribute to why so many people disagree on the """"proper"""" direction to turn it.

What exactly is the advantage of turning it the """"right"""" way versus the """"wrong"""" way?
Too often I hear that turning it the """"wrong"""" way is """"more likely to round off the corners"""" without any more details,
but I prefer an explanation that would make it possible to work out from first principles which way is the """"right"""" way.

I'll go ahead and do the page move.  I'll probably wait till tomorrow my Internet time is drawing to a close, and since I haven't done hatnotes very often, I'll want some time to read up on them and correct any mistakes that I make.

Regarding references, I don't think you need to include a citation after every sentence, as long as they're not direct or indirect quotes, and/or potentially controversial in any way.  This is especially true if a whole paragraph comes from a single source in that case, I just put a single citation marker at the end of the paragraph.  If I use multiple sources in a paragraph, but I don't quote anybody or include anything that might come into dispute, I usually stick a string of citations at the end of the paragraph.  To me, that makes the text a little more readable.

Also regarding citations, you can save yourself a few keystrokes on repeated citations where you're using a name.  Once you've created a citation with a name, you don't have to type """"""""; you can just use """""""", with the slash at the end of the tag.  That'll give you a tiny bit less keyboarding to do, and it also makes it a little easier to edit when there's a string of citations less risk of losing the closing """""""" tag.  I've done this with the Lt. Cherry article, if you'd like to check it out.

If you want to get a little fancier, I like to use list-defined references, which is what I did with Lt. Cherry's article.  Basically, that involves putting the citation information inside the {{Reflist}} in the references section.  That way, it doesn't get eliminated by accident if somebody edits out a passage including citation information and doesn't check the edit summary to make sure that they're not orphaning a """""""" tag.  It's also easier to read the text in the edit window if you don't have to wade through tangles of citation details.

By the """"Ft. Table"""", did you mean the boxed business in the upper right?  In Wikiparlance, that's known as an infobox, and you put them in using templates.  The one you'd probably want to use for Ft. Niobrara is Template:Infobox military installation.  If you'll follow that Wikilink, you can see how it works.  You don't have to fill in all the parameters on an infobox if some of them aren't applicable or if you don't have the information, you can leave them blank.

Good luck with the Ft. N. article; leave me a note if I can be of help.  I'll keep it on my watchlist and render what assistance I can.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Patrick Walsh on the role of """"extreme rightwing"""" Agent-Provocateurs
As documented by the former Royal Canadian Mounted Police undercover agent, Mr. Patrick Walsh, in a recently published book in Canada, """"The Unholy Alliance"""", Zionists have played a major role in promoting """"Nazi"""" and other allegedly anti-Jewish movement. The much publicised """"Nazi"""" leader Lincoln Rockwell was a creature of the Zionist terror machine, and played a major role in persuading rich American Jews that they should contribute to the Zionists, who would protect them from threatened """"anti-Semitism"""". Patrick Walsh thoroughly exposes the role of the agent provocateur. The Walsh exposures have, according to Canadian reports, thrown the Zionists and their dupes into some confusion. 

Patrick Walsh would have been most interested to hear Andrew Campbell's strong objection to a recent reference to """"Zionist thuggery"""". He was the victim of this thuggery when brutally attacked by a group of Jewish Defence League members outside a room in the Royal York Hotel, Toronto, who were attempting to break up a school being conducted by Eric Butler. Zionist thuggery has been used against lawful patriotic groups right around the world. The League of Rights has constantly warned against extending encouragement to any type of violence, stressing that evil policies can be defeated through the British system of constitutional government.

 User:Varsovian 

Instead of keeping a low profile for awhile he immediately inserted himself into a discussion on WikiProject about the Nazi collaborator Anthony Sawoniuk. The nationality of Anthony Sawoniuk is yet determined, the only source which says his mother was Polish is a newspaper article. In a provocative style Varsovian started to compare the Nazi collaborator and war criminal Sawoniuk with Frederic Chopin(!).  """"That makes him more Polish than Chopin!"""", """"If Sawoniuk isn't Polish, neither is Chopin"""". I have asked him what has Chopin to do with Sawoniuk and reply was this:  """"if he isn't Polish, neither is Chopin"""", """"Unless we can find a source which says that Sawoniuk's father was a nationality other than Polish, Sawoniuk is purely Polish"""". This is crazy, he should provide sources that Sawoniuk and his father is Polish not others that he is not. Not happy enough that he needlessly dragged Chopin's name into the discuss on a Nazi collaborator, he opened a new section titled Chopin vs Sawoniuk. . I asked him to provide sources:  and the reply was this:  no sources provided and more comparisons between F.Chopin and Sawoniuk. He also accused me that I am """"trying to distract attention from yet another warning you this week received despite being under a DIRWIGEN official caution"""". I am most certainly not trying to distract attention from anything but I have a problem when somebody compares a Nazi collaborator of uncertain nationality with Frederic Chopin.

A major advance of this assessment of climate change projections compared with the TAR is the large number of simulations available from a broader range of models.

Model simulations cover a range of possible futures including idealised emission or concentration assumptions.

 Comment from Homosexuality (workspace) 

Actually, my citation can be the very same 2000 Breedlove study that our friend in Farmington includes in Fetal hormones and sexual orientation. Background is that length of ring finger relative to index finger is strongly correlated with fetal testosterone levels. That fact is rather well established quite apart from sexual orientation. Breedlove found an additional much weaker correlation between implied fetal testosterone and sexual orientation, with lesbians in particularly being most strongly androgynized. It's definitely interesting. Gay men show the same pattern (gays more androgynized), but to a smaller degree.

However, there is a huge overlap between the suggested fetal testosterone levels and sexual orientation. That is, on average of a bunch of lesbians had higher fetal testosterone than a paired group of straight women. But many lesbians had lower fetal testosterone than the straight-woman average. And many straight women had higher fetal testosterone than the lesbian average. The standard deviation within each group is much more than the mean difference between the groups.

So what does it show? Well, I dunno. There's something potentially interesting there, especially if it can be replicated in much larger samples. But it's hardly clear causation, nor even clear correlation. What it amounts to might be something like (purely hypothetically): """"High testesterone exposure female fetuses have a 10% chance of becoming lesbian; low testosterone exposure female fetuses have a 5% chance of becoming lesbian."""" But that's about the strongest conclusion I can imagine coming out of this (and it hasn't yet, it's been suggested), and that's a relatively weak factor.

The """"N"""" was for networking. I provided hooks in the PET ROM so that the """"Teacher's PET"""" be attached to a master-slave network. In the Commodore 64 there was a cartridge with the networking software and an interface card to the 6522 serial port.  We had two test installations in New Brighton Middle School in Capitola, Ca. and the Watsonville Middle School in Watsonville, Ca. Both had a PET with 30 C-64's. I developed all the hardware and did the fabrication myself.  Later a school in Wayne, PA was set up with a similar installation.

Another misconception is the origin of the Vic-20.  The real creator of the concept was Jim Kennedy who was the Commodore engineering manager after Chuck Peddle left in August, 1978 to work at Apple. Jack Tramiel asked him to visit MOS and he talked to Bob Yannes where he got the specs for the VIC chip.  He and I discussed a prototype VIC-20  but unfortunately Kennedy was canned in February 1980 when CHuck was re-hired by Commodore.

The Objectivity of this Discussion is doubtful (non-existent)

(1) As indicated earlier, the section on Marxist leaders’ views is misleading:

(a) it lays unwarranted and excessive emphasis on Trotsky, creating the misleading impression that other prominent Marxists (Marx, Engels, Lenin) did not advocate and/or practiced terrorism;

(b) it lays unwarranted and excessive emphasis on the theoretical “rejection of individual terrorism”, creating the misleading impression that this is the main (only) Marxist position on terrorism. 

(2) The discussion is not being properly monitored:

(a) no discernible attempt is being made to establish and maintain an acceptable degree of objectivity;

(b) important and relevant scholarly works such as the International Encyclopedia of Terrorism are being ignored or illicitly excluded from the discussion;

(c) though the only logical way to remedy the blatant imbalance in the above section is to include quotes by/on other leaders who are known to have endorsed and practiced terrorism all attempts to do so have been systematically blocked with impunity by the apologists for Marxist terrorism who have done their best to sabotage and wreck both the article and the discussion.

(3) Among the tactics deployed by the apologist wreckers and saboteurs the following may be identified as representative examples:

(a) it is claimed that Marx and Engels did not advocate terrorism despite the fact that scholarly works like the International Encyclopedia of Terrorism show that they did, and Marx himself was known as “The Red Terror Doctor”;

(b) it is claimed that Marx and Engels were not involved in terrorist activities despite the fact that numerous sources from The Neue Rheinische Zeitung to Isaiah Berlin and Francis Wheen state otherwise;

(c) it is claimed that Lenin does not refer to terror in The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade K. Kautsky and other works/statements despite the fact that Robert Service, IET, and other scholarly and reliable sources state that he does;

(d) it is claimed that the Russian word ‘’strakh’’ does not mean “terror” when:

i. the Oxford Russian Dictionary says that it does;

ii. it is evident from the context that this is the case;

iii. any educated Russian speaker can confirm that strakh may mean “terror” depending on the context;

(e) it is claimed that Marxism is “scientific” when in fact:

i. Marx was not a scientist;

ii. Marx’s background was philosophy and law, not science;

iii. Marxism is not recognized as a science by the academic world;

iv. virtually every one of Marx’s predictions turned out to be wrong, as became increasingly apparent during his lifetime and incontrovertibly so after his death (R. Pipes, Communism: A Brief History, 2001, p. 15) from which it follows that Marxism does not qualify as a scientific system by any accepted standards;

v. the evidence indicates that Marxism is closer to a religious sect than to science proper;

(f) apologist literature is being quoted in a fraudulent attempt to whitewash Marxist terrorism, in effect turning the discussion into an advertisement for terrorism;

(g) it is claimed that Marxist terrorism is not rooted in the Marxist theory of class struggle even though there are numerous sources showing that it is (please note that it is immaterial whether terrorism had already been justified in terms of a theory of class prior to Marx, the point being that it was advocated/practiced on the basis of Marxist class-struggle theories BY MARXISTS):

“Karl Marx felt that terror was a necessary part of a revolutionary strategy” (Peter Galvert, “Theories of Terror in Urban Insurrections”, IET, p. 138);

“Revolutionary terrorism has its roots in a political ideology, from the Marxist-Leninist thinking of the Left, to the fascists found on the Right” (Noemi Gal-Or, """"Revolutionary Terrorism"""", IET, p. 203);

“… perhaps the most important key to Stalin’s motivation lies in the realm of ideology. The leitmotif of Soviet communist ideology in the 1920s and 1930s was class struggle – the inbuilt antagonism between mutually incompatible economic interest groups” (Geoffrey Robert, Stalins Wars, 2006, pp. 17-18);

this fact is supported not only by reliable academic sources, but by elementary logic: 

“In 1907 Mehring published in the magazine ‘’Neue Zeit (Vol. XXV 2, p. 164) extracts from a letter by Marx to Weydemeyer dated March 5, 1852. In this letter, among other things, is the following noteworthy observation: … class struggle necessarily leads to the dictatorship of the proletariat …”",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Perhaps the """"self-advertising"""" character of this article would be somewhat abrogated by a little criticism.  In this article http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/a-defence-force-of-terminators-is-almost-here-20090510-az6u.html?page=2 he writes: 

""""Remember, one of the rules when it comes to technology is Moore's law, that the computing power that can fit on a microchip doubles just under every two years. If this trend holds true, as it has for the past several decades, Australia's Force 2030 will be operating in a world in which our information technology will be a billion times more powerful than today. Notably, this isn't an amorphous """"billion"""", as Dr Evil would pontificate in the movie Austin Powers, but literally taking the power of our current computers multiplying it by 1,000,000,000. But imagine if that law doesn't hold true, and Moore's Law works out at only a hundredth of its past pace. Then the computers that power robots in the era of Force 2030 will only be a mere 1,000,000 times more powerful.""""

Ironically, his grasp of numeric quantities is probably even further off than Dr. Evil's.  If """"computing power"""" doubles every two years for twenty years, the resulting increase in computing power would be just 1024 times more powerful (2^10 = 1024 see http://www.google.com/search?q=2^10&ie;=utf-8&oe;=utf-8&aq;=t), not """"a billion"""".  And if computing power increased at 1/100th of its current pace (i.e. instead of doubling, increasing at one-one-hundredth of 2 = 0.02 per annum), the resulting increase in power would be just 1.02^10: computers would be 1.21899442 times as powerful as those today.

All this would probably be more relevant if he even managed to get Moore's Law correct in the first place.  Moore's Law did not relate to """"computing power"""" but to the density of transistors in a given area.  In practical terms, a doubling of the number of transistors /= doubling of computing power... so we CERTAINLY aren't going to facing armies of Terminators, a """"billion"""" times more computationally powerful than the robots of today!!!

Dear MisfitToys,

My name is Jonathan Obar user:Jaobar, I'm a professor in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences at Michigan State University and a Teaching Fellow with the Wikimedia Foundation's Education Program. This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the communityHERE, where it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students.

So a few things about the interviews:
 Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes.
 Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.)
 All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so.
 All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time.
 The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly.

Bottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name instead.

If you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu. I will be more than happy to speak with you.

Thanks in advance for your help. We have a lot to learn from you.

One with the right degree of integrity, the proper knowledge of the stuff, here physic, a thourough insight in the affair and its history, and a knowledge of the people involved and their characters and profile in regard to the topic.
I think here of Nicholas Turnbull, administrator, and expert in mediation.

I have, unfortunately, to aknowledge the fact that your latest actions have resulted in creating a turmoil on the site, based both on your actions and your utterings, and that you have provocated 50% of the users, who had already been harshly provocated by user r-b-j for several weeks and needed therefor the administrators help to put an end to it, not to overtake the place of the source of turmoils.

I do believe that you are acting your best with your actual knowledge of the facts, but nonetheless you should be more carefull to don't bruise som ego by commiting unfully justified and unjust actions in the process, and as a consequence endanger the quality of the talk page.

As those arguments for and against have been dancing in parallel for far too long time, without everreaching a solid ground of agreement, and as references made by anti bogdanov are always pointed at some unclear statement made by scientifics a long time ago, where most did redraw it, and as all those people of science didn't knew a thing about Theoretical Physic and/or Cosmologie, which this dispute is about, and as the positiv statements, made by specialists in the fields named above, are systematically unaccepted for tricky reasons, as are the statements made on this page by pro-bogdanovian, who are called socket puppets for a yes or for a no, I suggest this affair to be settled once and for all by truly and undiscustably specialists in that field, I named Holger Beck Nielsen professor of the Copenhague Niels Bohr Institut of Theoretical Physic, and Stephen W. Hawking, from the Chair of Mathematic of Cambridge University.

I have already made the necessary steps in order to bring professor Holger Beck Nielsen attention to that matter, and would like to know if anyone feel of doing the same in England.
I tried already to suggest this approach above, but it seems that my suggestion was drawned in the tumults of the fights and remained ignored.
I will ask you to make a join effort to gather your attention on this particular possibility and think of how each of you can take part in its fullfillment, in the best interest of all parts involved.

Response to help desk

Hi Rockingchick. Sorry your article was deleted, but it sounds like you were writing a biography of a non-notable person. We can't generally let people write articles about people they know or knew personally because it violates our policies of having everything verified by reliable sources (if you write about someone the wider world hasn't heard of we have no way of making sure what you wrote is true) and writing from a neutral point of view (you can't be neutral about someone you know personally). There are more specific guidelines as to who's considered notable at WP:BIO.

If you'd like some ideas for a good first article, you can try the Your first article (which is more a list of """"don't""""s) and the Requested articles pages. The community portal also has lots of other ways in which people can contribute to Wikipedia apart from writing new articles.

My two main suggestions are to make smaller improvements to the article and to use more than one source. Unless you are very skilled at proper paraphrasing, using a single source greatly increases the risk of close paraphrasing, i.e. improper paraphrasing, and also leads to a very one-sided view of the subject. I've added two reference to the article with links to their pages on Google books (most of which are visible, at least in the UK). The print copies may also be in the Longy library:
Marco, Tomás (1993). Spanish Music in the Twentieth Century. 
Draayer, Suzanne Rhodes (2009). Art Song Composers of Spain: An Encyclopedia
The previous reference I had added—Romero, Justo (2004). Liner Notes: Joaquín Turina (1882–1949): Piano Music, Vol. 1—is also very useful, especially for discussing his musical style and works chronology. I suggest you use these as your sources for further expansion with the biography on joaquinturina.com] as a back-up only.
 
One thing you could do is separate out the last paragraph (beginning with """"His works include..."""") with its own heading Music and expand the commentary there. For example, he was a very noted composer of art song, which is given short shrift in the article. Much has been written about his approach to incorporating Spanish musical idiom in his work and on his style in general, including its strengths and weaknesses. This is also lacking in the article.
 
Another possibility, is to separate out a section at the beginning of biography to Early years where you discuss his family background and his musical education prior to Paris. The material between that section and Music could be entitled Paris and Madrid and can always be expanded in the future.
 
A third possibility is to expand and rationalize the list of works in the article. The current one has three major problems. First, it excludes many of his important works because it relies solely on those scores available at IMSLP. Secondly, it gives no indication of each work's type. Thirdly, it gives no indication of the date of their composition. Listing them alphabetically, is not a good way to go. If you do decide to concentrate on improving the works list, I suggest using List of compositions by Claude Debussy by genre as a model, although in this case, the list would not be a separate article, but rather continue to appear in the Selected works section of Joaquín Turina.
 
Hope that helps. Best,   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Destructuring of the article
Ladies and gentlemen, apart from painful neutrality issue, I'm concerned with the growing deformation of the article's structure and style. I'm talking mainly about the actions of the definite national group of editors (which I could avoid naming unless it renews its usual personal attacking again).

Two weeks ago I removed the duplicating and excessicely-detailed sentences, as well as irrelevant images from """"Ukraine"""" section, and the other side seemed to agree non-images edit. Now I find new duplicating passages in the first section (although the intro looks better now). Editors who responsible for this: did you care reading section in the whole? And more, new lenghty redundant subsection on Vitebsk appeared. Not to mention the images, which litter only """"Ukraine"""" section (is this a permanent trollish attack on Ukrainian editors?).

Why doing things like that? I can understand POV-pushing intentions of pro-partisans users... But we must first of all care about innocent readers, not concerned with survival of either Russia or Ukraine. Otherwise the project would degrade, and Jimbo would run out of his budget.

 Ataturk and Kurds 

AW, the article is about Ataturks life in a factual historical context. It is about the things he had done in his life. Not about what Kurds think of him.

Let's take Coca-Cola for example, a completely benign subject. If someone said """"Pepsi lover's critique Coke for being too acidic"""" (source:Pepsi lovers magazine)"""" would you consider that part of the history of Coke or part of the history of Pepsi lovers? It certainly is an opinion, that could only be the history of a Pepsi lover because Coke has nothing to with their taste or aspirations of how a cola should be. (sorry for the silly analogy but you get the point I hope). Furthermore, this maybe a fact (it's a fact that someone had this critique of coke), but it's not an historical event, a historical fact, nor is it NPOV. 

Now if you apply this to Kurdish """"criticizms"""", then you would get the same outcome. It's all a matter of taste. And there a millions critiques of Ataturks out there, some being offensive to Kurds. Shall we include those as well?

Not to mention, which Kurds criticized? When did they do this? How many are there? What are their credentials? So you also have a credibility problem here.

Moreover, your sources can't possibly speak for all Kurds. I would be surprised if you could dispute that FACT.

I think these are all the places that have any claim of being a capital of the United States.  Of these, New York City and Philadelphia have the strongest claims of being the first capital.  One question to answer is what constitutes being the first capital.  Do we start the clock at the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the Article of Confederation, or the Constitution.  I think that the Constitution would be the key event because before that, America was really a group of independent colonies rather than a nation.

Also, I believe that New York City did not have the physical infrastructure (buildings, etc.) in place to be an actual capital for the newly formed government.  I think it acted more as a temporary meeting place.  Philadelphia did have a lot of infrastructure for the federal government because it was trying to woe the government into making Philly the permanent capital.

In my opinion, Philly should be considered the first capital of the U.S. because it had actual capital buildings that were used by the government after the signing of the Constitution.  The fact that Philly was also used as the first capital of the colonies is not relevent in my opinion.

However, I am not a historian or an expert in early American history, so I don't want to update the article myself.  Also, from my research, there seems to be a lot of contention about which city is the first capital.  Would a historian or professor of history please comment on this issue and update the page.

 My letter to NeinN 

I am not NeilN's psychiatrist, and, as I haven’t examined NeilN, I won’t diagnose him. But because NeilN has turned himself into a public laboratory of psychopathology, I want to talk about how I'd give direction to a universal human development of culture, ethics, and morality. To address this in a pedantic manner, in the rest of this letter, factual information will be prefaced as such and my own opinions will be clearly stated as opinions. For instance, it is a fact that people used to think I was exaggerating whenever I said that like other volage-brained sensualists, he has a finely honed ability to welsh on all types of agreements. After seeing NeilN precipitate riots these same people now realize that I wasn't exaggerating at all. In fact, they even realize that when a friend wants to drive inebriated, you try to stop him. Well, NeilN is drunk with power, which is why we must drive off and disperse the obdurate bohemians who manufacture outrage at his castigators by attributing to them all sorts of uppity fairy tales.

If the only way to stop the Huns at the gate is for me to fall prey to NeilN's rhetoric and obfuscation, then so be it. It would sincerely be worth it because he had promised us liberty, equality, and fraternity. Instead, NeilN gave us sensationalism, propagandism, and officialism. I suppose we should have seen that coming, especially since NeilN claims to be supportive of my plan to confront and reject all manifestations of feudalism. Don't trust him, though; he's a wolf in sheep's clothing. Before you know it, he'll treat traditional values as if they were rapacious crimes. Not only that, but some benighted bloodsuckers are actually considering helping NeilN cause one-sided inclinations to be entered into historical fact. How quickly such people forget that they were lied to, made fun of, and ridiculed by NeilN on numerous occasions.

It's scary how effectively NeilN has been making a mockery of the term """"disproportionableness"""". I deeply regret the loss of life and injuries sustained by this tragedy. I am currently working to understand the surrounding circumstances so as to improve our ability to plant markers that define the limits of what is untoward and what is not. We have a dilemma of leviathan proportions on our hands: Should we strip the unjust power from those who seek power over others and over nature, or is it sufficient to put him in his place? In answer to that question I submit—and millions of people in this country and abroad unmistakably agree with me—that Bourbonism has served as the justification for the butchering, torture, and enslavement of more people than any other """"ism"""". That's why it's NeilN's favorite; it makes it easy for him to mute the voice of anyone who dares to speak out against him. You might think this is all pretty funny now, but I doubt I'll hear you laughing if, faster than you can say """"floccinaucinihilipilification"""", NeilN is successfully able to use paid informants and provocateurs to make higher education accessible only to those in the higher echelons of society. I've heard numerous complaints about his behavior. Many people I've talked to have complained that NeilN comports himself like a filthy pig, heedless of all needs but his own. Among these needs the paramount one seems to be the need to burn books. This backs up my point that he likes saying that better governance can be achieved by granting profitable concessions, permits, waivers, zoning variances, monopolies, and other such political machinations to his band. Okay, that's a parody—but not a very gross one. In point of fact, NeilN is extremely mawkish. In fact, my handy-dandy Mawkish-O-Meter confirms that prudence is no vice. Cowardice—especially NeilN's deplorable form of it—is. Now that you've read the bulk of this letter, it should not come as a complete surprise that some of the things NeilN says and some of the things he stands for are so feckless, it hurts to think about them. However, this fact bears repeating again and again, until the words crack through the hardened exteriors of those who would make a big deal out of nothing. I am referring, of course, to the likes of NeilN.

For example, why do Liverpool fans nowadays display the Uruguay flag at matches? Nationality is relevant and flagicons are simply a graphic means of conveying the information.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

 Goodbye everybody 

And what on earth is wrong about this article, specially if settet back where it originally belongs?
I do not accuse people to be socket puppet, I do not insult them with harsh and very illustrativ words, I do not call their articles for garbage or for saying nothing usefull, or for being idiots, nor ignorant, nor do I pretend that they do not contribute with anything on the talk page and never did, nor do I revert other users contributions, as YBM and rjb specially and mainly, as well as some other new users on the page like Maru that night and previous days did, and som other users belonging to the same side of the story.
If I had to be banished for that so had ybm and rjb and maru too and for a much longer period of time and their text to be removed, in fact all of them that night, as they didn't say much else but cynical and fruitless comments on other people works and destructiv critiscism who wasn't justify.
I tried more than 4 times to make them come v´back to ttheir mind and to sopt healding oil to the fire, but it didn't helped. They just had too much fun harrassing users all around the talk page, unpunished.
An objectiv analyse of the page will not only take much time but will most certainly show how true what I state here is.
There is a text that I do not found, an article with the copy/paste of the writting exchange between me and mister Jean Pierre Voyer, where he clearly stated his doing in this affair and his cooperation with YBM in the making of falsification of evidencies, and his arrogancy and proudness in doing so, added some discrepencies in his words and a major amount of respectlessness, and you have the picture of the person behind this all story.
I also received private mails from a mister Rupley, who is (which is) the name of one of YBMs' web site with plenty of litteracy of the kind of Voyer, and with links to Luven, also an ybms' website of the kind. It does not concern the Bogdanovs affair, but concentrate on the theories who corroborate the making of such a fake story and its justifications in doing so.
It's a hobby of some sort, like some like Shakespeare or a special branch of philosophy or politic or a sub for us mostly unknown special branch of a political - philosofical - opinionated - with social ramification kind of organisation, touching a very small group of individuals inclosed in their believes. 
There is plenty of the like all over the world, their reason for adding to those ideas are those people life and choices, which I do respect, but in that case, those idiosyncrasies (thats my own choice of denomination and not theirs)are being punched ininto the reality of a lot of people and involved real ideas.
I think of course about the balancing act of inplanting those high flying ideas to the reality of the thousands of internet users by imposing their vues inthis Bogdanov affair. By vues I do not mean the apparent version of the fact given by YBM about the validity of the actual thesis. No. It isn't what it is about. It is more complex than that. It is about playing with people reactions in a situation of confrontations and playing with lies. Creating stories, ideas, like gossips who have no bund in the rality but who will nonetheless create a reaction in the people who are witnessing it at the time, and build on further from those reactions, and add more and more stuff to keep the tension and the artificial affair going on.
It might not be as complicated as it sounds to bring those ideas to live, as it very quickly get a dynamic of its own who keep repeating itself, if some element are implemented along the way.
It has roll this way for 2 years now, and the scenario are pretty much the same from a Forum to another.
One can see the same scenarios coming up, the same elements who keep coming back, the same strange behaviours at odd time, and the same surprising reactions when prooven wrong: a war take place, fill with denials, wild accusations, insults, personnal attacks, anything goes type of scenarios, with a lot of drama and tension in it, and many people getting injured, and leaving too. 
mostly those who came with the unbeatable arguments as I saw it so many times on fr. physic, from june to november 2004.
Looking at it after without having a part of it, give the priviledged view of the whole thing in a very short period of time , in one view, and here all those flaws are very obvious and it seems estonishing that nobody noticed it at the time. The game is very clear that way, and it was clear for me that there was something wrong going on, something who wasn't right, a mismatch.

 Marduk = Abraham.

Idris was the second prophet of Tengri, which became """"Thor"""" many places sometimes god, sometimes more of a prophet, and again """"Indra"""", """"Prometheus"""", """"Osiris"""".

 Reply Dear you are right in your argument.

The User   Walkie-talkie is coming out with some crasy arguments that there is nothing even to discuss about the """"Terrorist category"""". I don’t know whether he is thinking Wikipedia should be monopolized by the fascist Sri Lankan killers who are some or other way marginalizing the Tamils in Sri Lanka since the independence. He is talking about commonsense. I don’t think so even he has an iota of that.

If Anton Balasingham could be named as the chief strategist and the chief negotiator or the apologist of one of the most barbaric terrorist groups, what about the following atrocities against Sri Lankan Tamils since the independence by the Sri Lankan State.

State Terrorism in Sri Lanka

If you go through the above incidents you will come to know they are many times worse than the highest number of suicide attacks which were targeted against innocent civilians by the LTTE.

I couldn’t understand what is the importance of that banning in 20 countries when hardly most of the countries civilians had not been killed by the LTTE attacks and the LTTE's activities are expanded into those countries only to the extent of fund raising from the expatriate Tamils.

He was the political adviser not the adviser to LTTE leader to carry out suicide attacks or to scheme military activities.

Composing the LTTE leader's annual speech or representing LTTE doesn’t qualify him for the """"Terrorist Tag"""" at all.

Why the talks failed every time was mainly the hardliners in the South and not by any of the Tamil groups or LTTE.

It is so stupid expecting he definitely knows all the crimes being carried out by the LTTE when he was utilised by the LTTE only at theoretical level and for negotiations.

I don’t know why that particular wikipedian feels sorry for him. For what?

""""Zervas was forced to resign in 1947, when details of his contacts with the German occupation authorities surfaced"""" This quote came from Wikepedia's biography of Napoleon Zervas. Other sites are more explicit and call him a Nazi collaborateur. Nowadays there are still a lot of greek people that believe that the Cham people were expelled because they collaborated with the Nazi's. However it was Zervas thet collaborated with the Nazi's that expelled them. Shouldn't this be more explicit in this article. There is a UN resolution which asks the Greek government to repatriate the cham and to give back there properties.The rest of this article is lame. I miss the following:

Copyright © 2006 Illyrians.org.
During the Conference of Ambassadors in London in 1913, the southern part of the region was cut off from the motherland and annexed to the Greek state despite the fact that people of the southern Epirus were Albanians of Orthodox and the Muslim faith. While the orthodox Albanians were targets of hellenization, the muslim Albanians were either exterminated or expelled from their ancestral lands by the Greek government.

Chams who lived in Southern Epirus (Chameria or Thesprotia as it is called by the Greeks) were the victims of the first ethnic cleansing in Europe at the end of the Second World War. The Cham tragedy is one of the most painful tragedies of the European continent. Statistical yearbook of the Greek government in 1936 showed that 26.000 Chams lived in Chameria region in Greece at that time.

As a result of the 1944-1945 ethnic cleansing and genocide, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region, and sought refuge in the Republic of Albania, where they still live. Today, there are 150.000 members of this population in Albania, a figure that has grown because of the high birth rate of the population. On the other hand, current number of Cham Albanians living in Greece is estimated at around 100.000. Yet these people are deprived of every sort of minority rights like other minorities living in Greece. To cite but one example, they can speak Albanian only in their homes.

The population of Chameria has always been ethnically Albanian: - A lot of voyagers and foreign historians wrote that Chameria had been populated by Albanians. Even the Greek historian Herodotus underscored this fact in his book Historias and called Albanians of the Chameria barbarians, a term used by the ancient Greeks to distinguish non-greek people. - The census held by the Turkish Administration in 1910 established that there were 83.000 orthodox and muslim Albanians in the region. The demographic map of the British military mission sent to the British government in London indicates that on the eve of the second World War, 75% of Chameria's population was Albanian. - The pro-Greek historian Spiro Muselimi, in his book """"Historical Sight Through Thesprotia"""", edited in Joannina on 1974, wrote that """"The bishop of Thesprotia in the year 1870 translated some parts of Bible into Albanian, as the people of orthodox faith of the region did not understand any word in Greek"""" .

The Greek authorities, sticking to the concept of absolute denial of the existence of ethnic groups on Greek territory, have followed a well-established chauvinistic policy and, as history recorded, they committed genocide against the Albanians of muslim faith. The racial assault on Chameria's muslim Albanians began to be first applied at the end of the Second World War, in 1944-1945, when criminal bands of the notorious General Napoleon Zervas perpetrated ethnic cleansing against them.

On June 27, 1944, Greek criminal bands resorted to the worst atrocities witnessed in this region. The terror committed against this population was beyond description. It included killings, rapes, inhuman treatment, massacre of women, babies and pregnant women. More than 1400 men, women and children were killed within 24 hours in the town of Paramithy, on Tuesday, June 27, 1944, which happened to be the date of St.Bartholomeus day for the whole Chameria.

During the June 1944-March 1945 period, 1286 persons were killed in Filat, 192 people were killed in Gumenica, 626 persons were killed in Margellic and Parga. There were hundreds of other missing persons. In the same period, as a result of Greek massacres, acts of robbery and rapes against the Albanian population of Chameria; 2900 young and old men, 214 women, 96 children were massacred, 745 women were raped, 76 women abducted, 32 children, younger than 3 years were massacred, 68 villages were razed to the ground, 5800 houses and places of worship were burned dow",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

 Nude beach & controversy 

In using the terms I have used in writing and revising this part of this article, I have sought to improve the article for the widest reading audience. I do believe the words I chose when writing this part do serve that end better than some of the changes another keeps making. All opinions are of equal value in Wikipedia, including this part of the article about a legal controversy, even if I feel that I bring to the table both an English degree and a Juris Doctor.

I have learned in my experience that some legal terms (e.g., """"upheld"""" being misunderstood understood to mean """"held up,” rather than being more correctly understood  as an action more akin to """"approving"""" a lower court’s decision) can be confusing to all levels of readers,  intelligent well-educated  readers and average readers alike. Yet, on the other hand, one does not want to completely avoid the use the accurate legal terms for those readers who understand and appreciate their use.

 The actual options for the lede sentence upon which we are !voting have not changed, and
 I don't want Mies to complain after the fact that the wording was skewed. Very little happens in this particular little corner of Wikipedia without either Mies' approval or anguished and dogged resistance. I would like him to feel that the process is as open and transparent as possible. Sentence options 1 and 2 are those which emerged from a far longer list as being the binary choices, and option 3 is Mies' own wording, which I think is an excellent compromise.

It is not the place of this talk page to conduct some kind of forensic investigation into the validity or otherwise of Mr Langan's IQ (I'm not saying that is what you are doing, just making a point). I agree with you that at this high end of the scale the measurement of IQ probably becomes quite inexact, but after all that is not Mr Langan's fault. I note also that not only is there no evidence Mr Novelly is lying, neither is there any evidence that Mr Langan has lied. That doesn't make his claims true, but the claims themselves are plausible as claims, and as claims they are reported in legitimate secondary sources. I think it is clear that Mr Langan is, as you put it succinctly, frickin' smart. That is the real point of the IQ claims, and it is the basis of the interest in Mr Langan, since people are interested in the limits of how frickin' smart people can be.

Here are violations you have done here. WP:3RR, WP:AGF, WP:CIVIL, WP:POINT, WP:THREAT, No Personal Attack. You must read the article again, especially the intro. """"Defrauding people of money is presumably the most common type of fraud, but there have also been many fraudulent """"discoveries"""" in art, archaeology, and science.""""  The latter two fields are distinctly separate even thought archeoology is a kind of social science, scholarly, it belongs to anthropology and history. Fujimura is an archaeologist, so that his case has been a good example of the archaeological fraud. Therefore, you should've provided a good rationale for your removal of the perfect example from the article. Rather, you insist on replacing it with Korean example in order to retaliate against my revert. You also placed the new addition at the top of the section, and the placement is very odd because if you really want to compromise with me, you should've made a group to Fujimura, the other archaeological case and the science case. You think Hwang Woo-seok case is more notable and I think Fujimura is more notable, so we disagree on the point. Besides, google search result is sometimes deceptive, and it is also funny that Japanese editors strongly disagreed to reflect the method at Dokdo and Sea of Japan. hmm.. double standard?

In addition, you blatantly lie that I erased your addition and don't want it to be included. Your threats and personal attacks truly degrade your reputation and credibility.

I would hope that you read both the source and my points fully before making your edit and writing your response.

As I initially said the source is biased - it is true. They state themselves that their very organisation was set up initially purely to oppose Nuclear Power.

Let's leave that to one side however, we could always come back to it later.

The crux of my point, leaving aside the bias issue, is three-fold. 

Firstly, irrespective of your argument that this is presented as a claim, the fact remains that the way the claim is presented is illogical - there is no fair comparator for the claim that """"Nuclear Power is neither efficient nor effective in cutting CO2 emissions"""". A fair comparator should be found or some idea of efficiency viz. inefficiency should be presented, if even from the biased source itself, before re-inserting this part. Without it, it is on the same level as saying something as intellectually vacant as """"some people claim that Ferraris are not fast machines"""". Not exactly the sort of style an Encyclopaedia should be aiming for, especially on a scientific article, would you not agree?

Secondly, with respect to your argument, the very empirical information the underlying source uses is being mistreated in what amounts to, if I may say, a misuse of data on a level which is so obvious it it would actually be quite comical if it were where it belonged along with many thousands of other equally lazy special interest group papers. It is  a self-contradicting source. Here's why:

It makes its supposition that Nuclear Power is inefficient at cutting CO2 emissions by producing a table of data. The data shows """"Yearly Costs to Avoid 1000kg of CO2 Emissions"""". These are divided between Energy Conservation Measures and Energy Production Methods. Nuclear Power is shown to be more efficient than solar power and as efficient as wind power at cutting emissions. However, the only conclusion the article draws is that Nuclear Power is inefficient at cutting CO2 emissions. By your logic, I could equally claim in this article using the same source that """"some environmental groups claim Wind and Solar Power are inefficient at cutting CO2 emissions"""". You can see how this would get a little crazy, no?

Thirdly, there is only one quoted source yet the text reads """"but environmental organizations indicate the problems with nuclear waste and claim that this energy is neither efficient nor effective in cutting CO2 emissions, excluding it from clean energy"""". Why is it pluralised? Surely the text should read something along the lines of """"the WISE group, a Dutch anti-nuclear lobby group indicate the problems..."""".

In conclusion, I can see the point you are trying to raise here is based on one guideline - as a claim, it is not presented as fact. That would be fine for articles dealing with philosophical issues, or political issues or any other number of normative debates. But we are not discussing ethics here. We are discussing the efficiency of Nuclear Power in cutting CO2 Emissions. We have to hold Scientific articles to a higher level of proof when it comes to """"making claims"""" or worse, """"stating beliefs"""". Science, prima facie, is about the pursuit of absolute truth, not the espousal of circumscribed belief. That way leads to the abuse of Science.

I'm happy to believe that the name """"Blackbeard"""" is used to describe a character in an upcoming movie. The issue for this article is why that is sufficiently significant to the modern cultural understanding of Blackbeard, for it to warrant inclusion in the article on the historical figure. Simply stating that Blackbeard is mentioned in a modern-day film/book/comic/play doesn't tell us anything about how the historical figure is interpreted, and risks being indiscriminate information which does little to advance our understanding of the topic. I suspect before we include the fact that Blackbeard wll be mentioned in yet another modern movie, we would need to know how this mention is of enduring cultural significance. I also doubt that the real-life Blackbeard can be presented in a historically accurate context in the otherwise fictional universe of POTC> More likely, and with all respect to Ian McShane, it is likely Blackbeard will simply be a large black-bearded pirate who has matches in his beard and says """"Yarr."""" An entertaining figure no doubt, but not one that advances this article, which is about the real-life Caribbean pirate.

I don't mean this to sound snarky, so my apologies if it comes across that way. It's just that articles like this can quickly amass extensive and fairly trivial lists of mentions, including every time the subject is even referred to in sitcoms and the like. Check out the page history from about a year ago, to see what I mean. I'd prefer not to return to simple lists of mentions, even when Blackbeard is a major character in the film/novel/comic/TV episode. Instead and for what its worth, I support Parrot's suggestion of mentioning it at the film's article, where it has apropriate context.

To present this information as if CPI(M) members are singular in their violence is not a correct viewpoint if violence is ongoing between many parties.

Thanks, that may at least defuse things a little.  

My personal thought is that if this is to get any mention on Ferdinand or Ferry Porsche's page the text should relate to them directly, rather than being the same cut and paste sentence.  

Mentioning that Ferdinand Porsche gets most of the popular credit for a lot of things that were actually as much or more a product of his employees, and pointing out that this is common practice in the design industry  the boss gets the credit  would be a bit more NPOV.  Mentioning Komenda as one of those who gets overlooked in favor of the boss would be OK for me too.

 22:46, 28 Oct 2003 (UTC)

Before I get any further on this subject, I would like clarificaton about the relative roles of Ferdinand and Ferry in this issue.  I would like to see the fact of Ferdinand's univolvement nailed down before I approach the matter of Ferry, or before I try to address the simple revert battle now going on here.

The bulk of the story clearly belongs on the Komenda page.  A one-sentence reference on the Ferry page saying that Ferry's claim is disputed is appropriate, and it should then refer those who want more on the story to the Komenda page.  01:57, 2003 Oct 29 (UTC)

This is the situation that I think is the truth, from my reading.  When Ferdinand Porsche set up an independent engineering consultancy in Germany (in the 30s?) although he was the company founder and head engineer he employed a number of other engineers - the jobs were too big for just one man.  Among the men he employed was Erwin Komenda, who had previously worked for Daimler-Benz and before that Steyr.  Komenda was an expert in auto body construction and the engineering of pressed sheet metal bodywork, that I can determine.  

Ferdinand Porsche's field of expertise seems to have been the mechanical aspects of vehicles, engines and the like, and the overall team direction.  Komenda worked on the bodywork of the KDF-wagen (later to become the Beetle) among others.  Komenda definitely worked on translating ideas for the basic shape into sheet metal and the detail design of the bodywork.  Many of the plans and patent applications from this period are signed by Komenda and applied for with his name on them.  Whether his were the first pencil sketches that were turned into auto bodies I am less sure.  It's certainly possible that they were, though I am sure others in the team including Ferdinand Porsche had a lot of input.

JUST A THOUGHT:

Shouldn't this page consider division into chapters:

(i.e.)
Early Life
WWI
WWII

Porche is a fascinating man with a career so linked with the World Wars  but that almost seems lost and in this bio. His involvement in WWII with the Nazis in both the Racing circuit and in the War effort really shaped his life and that that of the world. He represents a true place in history - so perhaps a chapter insersion could better work here.  Just a suggestion.
DH - 10/16/05
Postwar, Porsche's son Ferry and the other engineers who had worked for Ferdinand during the war came together (initially in Austria) to design cars.  Ferdinand was imprisoned until 1949 for war crimes relating to the use of slave labor in projects he worked on.

Between them, a car was designed that became the Porsche 356.  Komenda played a big part in this.  It would be incorrect to say that he was the designer, per se, because he only worked on the bodywork.  However, its construction was his, and probably much of its styling.  He also worked in a similar capacity for later Porsche cars.

What I think needs to be done is to write more about Ferdinand's consultancy and Ferry's postwar sports car company so Komenda can be placed in his proper context.  WHen part of a larger article it will seem less 'heavy'.

That in general, then, should be found upon the surface of England, map constructions which more or less roughly represent the whole of England, — all this has nothing puzzling about it. Any ordinary map of England spread out upon English ground would illustrate, in a way, such
possession, by a part of the surface of England, of a resemblance to the whole. But now suppose that this our resemblance is to be made absolutely exact, in the sense previously defined.""""  Royce goes on for awhile.

e4d907f77d1156ab,"I wonder why you think it's absurd to a) try and raise funds for those harmed by a natural disaster and b) to prove once and for all that these repetitive - almost chanting - claims I am Ennis are false. If the 'Number is Ennis' dichotomy was removed the Talk Pages would be near empty! I wonder why you condemn my attempts to bring honesty to these pages.

But, that's rhetorical - as I said, there must be certain camaraderie among Wiki people and I doubt if you’d want to jeopardise that even if your quest was integrity.

Now you have asked me a sensible question, so I'll answer.

For some time I watched these pages and saw that posts from people in the UK/claiming they were in the UK were summarily dismissed. Worse, posters were automatically accused of being Ennis.

One reason given was that the posts were anonymous.

So I thought, as I know more about Ennis than others from the UK posting here (IMO) I'd try to add to these pages. However, even with an identity, I got exactly the same treatment. In fact Cardinal Chunder also got the same treatment even though he has an anti-Sollog website and is well known in Google groups for arguing with sollog(ites).

So it became clear that it would be impossible to add anything constructive unless either the accusations 'You're a sock puppet! You’re Ennis!' were either suppressed or disproved.

I therefore asked what the criteria would be to 'prove' I was not Ennis - and presumably this criteria would apply to others. 

I tried to prove I was not in America (I thought these days all IPs were traceable but perhaps the 'proxy argument' holds sway - though quite how 'proxies work' is beyond me) I quoted extracts from a newspaper that was not on the net.

This was dismissed.

Someone else even went to a pub in Lyndhurst and posted what was next to where he was sitting.

That too was dismissed.

So it became obvious that no proof I (or anyone else) was not Ennis would ever be accepted.

Therefore the only other option if I felt I had something to contribute would be to suppress the hyena-like accusations (never backed up BTW)

In vain did I quote Wiki Official Policy. Plainly it is not obeyed by Editors/Administrators vis a vis the treatment of contributors.

So what is left? I cannot invoke Wiki policy. I cannot 'prove' I am here, in England sitting quietly in front of a PC.

Two choices.

Stop posting completely

Try and 'challenge' the main accuser so once and for all this behaviour would stop. The only challenge worth it would be one where I did not personally gain (Of course I would win because I am not Ennis) and where proof involving a third party held in esteem (e.g. Ashley) acted as 'witness'.

Hence the challenge.

I fear that will be deleted; I'll be castigated a usual and that's that. It really is just hopeless.

I have started deleting all my posts and if the challenge is reverted I’ll know there simply is no hope and I'll delete all my posts if I can find them.

You see, unless people accept I am not Ennis everything I or anyone else writes who is similarly accused will simply be dismissed. I'd prefer it if people read the post without looking at the poster - but they don't.

I have other interests - I posted on the Yoga page but it's quiet and I am interested in politics etc etc.

So we'll see what happens. Like I said, my view is that it's just hopeless trying to treat others as adults as all some want to do is - and they admit this - bait, bait and bait and if you do rise to it you're banned and if you don't it shows your inability. Truly a page that brings out the juvenile in what I assume are adults.

So there you are. I have answered your question fully and honestly and we'll just see what happens. It will answer the question - at least for these Sollog pages - as to whether Wiki should be taken seriously or not.

Finally if, as expected, the post is reverted it will provide a fitting end to the article I am writing (I am a freelance writer and no, I’m not going to prove it) before I send it off to newspapers.

Most importantly, the anonymously sourced article is the only news source claiming Artie has stabbed himself.  All other articles covering the suicide attempt refer to the New York Post as their only reference.

I can't see women buying rape oil. Even if they know better, it sounds like an antisocial alternative to KY jelly. 

If I recall correctly, regular rape oil is a drying oil, mostly used industrially, perhaps in some specialty paints. It's toxic, but I don't know *how* toxic. (A lot of the foods we eat are toxic. Salt is a necessity, but a cup of salt would be lethal to half of all adults who ingest it.)

 M-hmmmmmm....... 

So, you think that I was ranting, when during the entire article I explicitly noted that I am not, and that this is a serious issue that need not be """"stricken down"""" as hate speech or ranting. Let me rebut all the things you posted on my talk page:

- Ok, """".com"""" stands for commerce, but if you read my post without any bias in mind, that wasn't even my argument. I was just basically pointing out the fact that """".co.uk"""" is explicitly UK, and that """".com"""" can be anything, though it is necessarily NOT explicitely UK, as many of Wiki's articles seem to be.

- Yes, I said I didn't know where to start, meaning I didn't know where to begin addressing the issue, not that I don't know where to start addressing this issue.

- """"Secondly, there is Wiki policy that articles dealing with American topics have American English spellings, and articles about British stuff have British English spellings. If White House has British spellings in it, by all means change them to the US ones.""""
    
 I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to tell me here, but my guess is that you assume that I don't know about the current Wikipolicy, and that you obviously don't understand what I clearly stated. I am arguing that Wikipedia should either have ALL British spelling, or ALL standard English spelling (a.k.a - """"American english), but preferabally standard English because this isn't a British website, and because as an encyclopedia, all the information should be unified under one context and/or dialect.

- My point wasn't """"British are the only people that use British spelling."""" (although in a literal sense, this is a strong point outside of context), it was that """"The majority of the English speaking population use Standard English."""". If I seemed to use the former point, then either the way you interpreted my words was wrong, or I misworded my intentional argument. If I did, then my apologies.

- """"But every other English-speaking country used the standard spelling, which is generally based on how the word actually sounds"""" 
Again, you missed a subtle point that changed the entire meaning of my words. See the word generally? What I mean by this, if you can't already comprehend, is that many words in the British spelling include silent letters. Here's an example of one: pAEdophile. If one trys to pronounce this word by the letters, it would sound something like """"PAH-EHD-OH-FILE"""", adding an extra syllable, when it's really pronounced """"PE-DOH-FILE"""", which pretty much follows how the Standard English form is spelled. 

- I'm not very new to Wiki, and if that's a subtle way for you to try to undermind my intelligence, then I resent that statement. And again, do not take my words as rants. Anybody who understands the inherent nature of an encyclopedia understands that this is an important issue. Anyways, the way I worded my post was nowhere near the definition of a rant, please use a dictionary and find out what a rant is for yourself.

Please, if you can't understand the importance of this issue solely based on personal agenda (I understand you are British), then stay out of this. You have no credibility if this is the case since you cannot make a rational decision. If you haven't noticed, everything I posted had rationale behind it.

Liberalism, the belief in freedom and equality, is the American mainstream, and the same is true throughout most of the West.  The liberals in the sixties were as anti-communist as the conservatives.  The Left, then, were the communists, and the Right were the people who opposed labor unions and integration.

 Harry Potter is a Girl 

Dear Jimbo, I posted something here and it was archived because it was viewed that after a 3 day ban I was too expert in the use of WP:XXXX rules to be a newbie. It was said """"Will be archived: If you ever want to return, Jimbo can discuss this message (and your ADMINISTRATORS comment below) from his talk-page archives."""" I don't even know what that means. Here is my reply to the person that said that. And then the thing that was archived. The longer article was deleted off the page I put it on. I will glance back at my talk page to see if you have anything to say on this matter. If not I understand that it is not your issue. I would though prefer if you looked at it since that was my point, that people in power beneath you seem to want to bite the newbie to the point that the newbie is leaving and not coming back. They even suggested that my issue was with the WP:3RR rule which was not the issue. As a newbie I didn't know about that, and learned my lesson. It was with the time on the talk page being attacked by a WP:GANG / WP:TAGTEAM which are supported by administrators. So the person who archived my comments of your talk page didn't even get the point. Once I was told of the WP:3RR rule I never even touched the article again. Anyway hopefully you will actually read this before someone else finds a WP:XXXX rule as an excuse to delete it. 86.93.139.223  

So you understand, I had 3 days of a block to read the many WP:XXXX that were thrown at me, to then understand them. So while it might be hard for you to believe that someone can read in 3 days a bunch of WP:XXXX rules, it is not impossible. Actually I didn't have to read many, just the ones that were used against me to have me blocked. As I found, they were being totally misquoted against me. So yeah, you might find it hard to believe, you might also want to go to the Alkaline Diet article and look at how many people said exactly the same thing as I did in the past on the article. Is that hard to believe? Don't bother answering, just know that you might want to look at the history and deal with it. I don't understand why this was taken off Jimbo Wales' page by someone other than him with a note hard to believe. Isn't that his choice? Yes I would like him to discuss it with me. As I put it on his page with the express comment that the people (like you) who are in between him and me are the problem. So you making a personal judgement that someone can't read a few Wiki WP:XXXX rules in 3 days gives you the right to ignore my very detailed comments. Sorry but this is exactly the reason I contacted Jimbo and not you. Maximus. 86.93.139.223 (talk)  86.93.139.223  

Dear Jimbo, This is a part of a longer post on the Alkaline Diet page called Harry Potter is a Girl. As I am a newbie I don't know how to do links so copied it here. Sorry for taking your space up on your talk page. Also sorry for WP:TLDR. Please delete this if it is of no interest to you. I can't know what is and what is not of interest to you, and following WP:BOLD I am making my statement and you can decide what to do next. I have put it here as I wanted you to know of my experience here at Wikipedia and how after a few days due to repeated WP:BITE I am leaving Wikipedia editing never to return. Because the people between you and me are the problem I thought to go straight to the top. Sometimes the people at the top don't get told what is going on below them. Anyway thanks for Wikipedia. Good luck and perhaps reduce the number of rules / guidelines as I think they are being manipulated and misused.

 Wikia links in the SF articles 

There's little point, other than advertising, to randomly link to a wikia when an article is already on wikipedia. Unless you've got a solid reason for adding a link, you shouldn't add it.  
That's fine and dandy, but you'll find that adding a link to an article for advertising purposes is against wikipedia's policies. It doesn't help that the articles on the SF wikia are apparently copy and paste from existing articles here, which negates them further. Sorry, but they have to go.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Qumar:deletion
This… I don’t know where to start!
In no particular order:-
.a)I found this had been deleted when it turned up on my watchlist,, though I never saw the discussion there; presumably because it was on another page, and this deletion looks like an afterthought.
.b) “decision was to merge with The West Wing # Foreign …""""
Well, actually it wasn’t.
3 voted for merging Equatorial Kundu and Qumar in a new page Fictional Countries in the West Wing;
2 voted for merge and re-direct to WW#F (3 if you count yourself)
2 others had no preference.
In the event you didn’t even do that; a search for Qumar leads to the top of the WW page, making it necessary to scroll through to find it.
.c) I find it hard to believe this would be agreeable to anyone who is interested in, or has contributed to, the WW pages; does that describe anyone who spoke on this decision? 
.d)The reason for the proposal isn’t that clear; “not notable”? So where does that leave all the other pages about fictional characters, places, histories?
.e)“can be re-created if sources are found to establish out-of-universe notability”; what does that mean? If it’s referred to in a book, like a commentary on the West Wing (though you don’t know, and haven’t checked, if there is one)? (for the record, there are at least 5 in the British Library Catalogue, and at least one in our town library; shall I check? Would it make any difference?
.f)“theres nothing on the page that isn’t said elsewhere""""; Well, there was quite a big page before (from memory), now there’s just a paragraph, so something has gone. And if information is in several places, what does it matter? It makes sense to repeat things/items/details from various places onto a single page to make the information more accessible; even real encyclopaedias can do that, the more so a virtual one.
.g) ) The page wasn’t (again, from memory) badly written, or un-encyclopaedic, especially compared to some of the pages I’ve seen; is WP so big that we can afford to be tearing decent pages out? (it’s still not as big or as comprehensive as a decent-sized city library).

I get that formaldehyde and acetaldehyde are common names, but propionaldehyde? That's pushing it. Is it really used in chemistry more than propanal? I don't know about most people, but I couldn't be bothered to type all that in when I could just type in """"propanal"""".

 http://www.mediaradar.org/mcdowell_kanin_credible.php links to an interview where McDowell admits to research into false rape reporting.  theforensicexaminer/Gross (used in article) cites the 1281 sample size number, and the link to how it is possible that some people misquoted 556 has been quoted as: 

The discrepancy in the size of the dataset can perhaps be explained by the wording in the CfMR article which implies that the 556 case dataset was an earlier study “cited” in McDowell’s 1985 paper, not the main subject of it. The difference in percentages between CfMR and mediaRADAR might be explained by CfMR citing McDowell correctly, while the 60% figure was obtained by someone just adding the 80 “false” cases to the 256 “inconclusive” ones and calling them all false. (http://www.feministcritics.org/blog/2009/04/20/claims-about-mcdowells-research-into-false-rape-allegations-are-not-credible-noh/)

 but the mcdowell section (here) didn't include a 60% claim.  It included the 45% claim. No reason to throw that out.  We should use the 1281 sample size. One reason that the study is often attributed to McDowell and Hibler is their 1987 book """"Practical aspects of rape investigations"""" http://books.google.ca/books?id=iV398oA5DdsC&pg;=PA181&lpg;=PA181&dq;=charles+mcDowell+practical+rape+investigation&source;=bl&ots;=P2Yt9i_z6y&sig;=R-ezsxhzIw3KPJYGnybSBJp2BX8&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=0_59T8SGI6Xd0QGRoPTHDg&ved;=0CCsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q;=charles%20mcDowell%20practical%20rape%20investigation&f;=false , and so likely published there.  Perhaps we should disprove the existance of this book, before claiming that an unused potentially wrong version of McDowell exists invalidates that mcdowell exists.

As you know, having replied there before, this matter is already being discussed here, two headings up.  Perhaps the two heading should be merged to prevent confusion.  I'd hate for someone to stumble on this """"Recent Karwynn deletions heading and, by no intention of your own, think that I deleted disputed material without discussing it on the talk page.  Either way, here's what I have to say about the matter.  I know it's long, but bear with me - you might find the rambling actually makes some sense.

Weasel Words
Your examples of improving weasel statements should be appreciated for what they are, but unfortunately, they don't really apply here.  The full process you linked to involved escalating from """"some say"""" to """"BUsh's critics"""" to """"Michael Moore"""" followed by accounts of a specific statement, namely, Moore's letter to Bush.  Here, that process has not been fully employed.  Unlike the specifically referenced Moore letter to Bush, which was direct and obvious in who it represented, these sources themselves still contain weasel words; take this sentence: A White House long accused of squelching internal dissent and ignoring outside viewpoints.  Accused by whom?  As I said before, just because weasel words are sourced, even directly quoted, doesn't make them ok.  n your example, the weasel words were eliminated by referencing the source of criticism directly.  """"Michael Moore said whatever"""".  In this case, we still haven't discovered who is doing all the accusing.  To say that the Washington Post is making the accusation is inaccurate.  To say that the Washington Post says that Bush has been """"long accused"""" is an accurate weasel statement, not worthy of inclusion in an encyclopedia.  It fails verifiability as well, come to think of it: the article certainly doesn't bother to support the sentence.  Read it for yourself.  They just throw it out there.  Verifiability doesn't mean """"you can find it somewhere else"""", it means """"It's been or can be verified to be true"""".  Perhaps it can be, but this article doesn't do it.  Do you see the difference between this case and the example provided in the WP:AWW guideline?  In the guideline's example, the weasel words were overcome by citing.  In this case, they still remain, because they are inherent in the source itself.

Citing the opinions of these articles
Well, this problem should speak for itself.  Opinions, including those of journalists, should not be cited as support for a claim.  It would be one thing if these criticisms were being mentioned to verify their existence (see Laura Ingraham, an article in which numerous criticisms are used to self-verify, but not used to support a claim within the article that Laura Ingraham is good or bad or this or that), as they are for many public figures, but they are being used as support for this """"particularly notable because"""" statement.  As I said before, which was ignored this... well, I'll just repost what I said before.
It's not a neutral article, nor is it a notably important surce. It's just another source. I could find an article that says something along the lines of """"Stephen Colbert proved that he is a manipulative, arrogant polemicist who cares nothing for social graces and only wishes to make a name for himself by being extreme and controversial"""", and if I stuck that sentence in the article's main body and referenced it, it would be (rightly) reverted before long. The same if I found an article saying that the accusations against Bush being intolerant of dissention were just a knee-jerk criticism and a political tool, lacking any merit. We shouldn't be able to throw political commentary into articles without restraint based on the premise that it's """"sourced"""". This entire statement contains non-neutral commentary about the performance; I don't care if it came from somewhere else, it's still not neutral to include it.
So here are my thoughts on this point, summed up.
Citing opinions is fine for verifying the existence of those opinions/criticisms, but not for supporting the Wikipedia article's opinionated claims (which, see above, shouldn't be in there in the first place).
This article is not notable to the subject matter.  It's very broad, compared to the narrowness of the article's subject (and, even narrower, it's notability and the cause of it).  The specific criticisms are not uncommon, and the article's themselves are not controversial.  They are not important enough to be set apart as evidence pertaining to the performance's notability and Bush's reputation.  Additionally, the source is more focuse",0,0,0,0,0,0,False
02df732c2dcab497,"Thanks to all for taking my rather offhand comment seriously.  To reiterate my original explanatoin to James: I'm interested in this more on a meta level (how do we approach controversial subjects) than out of deep feelings one way or the other towards Moore and his film; that is, I'm trying to see the forest of making a good article on the film rather than the trees of every factual detail within the film that contributors might have multiple viewpoints about.  For an encyclopedia based around the concept of a Neutral Point of View, any attempt to either counter or defend the content of a subject that is, in itself, an editorial statment seems wrong; such discussions wind up as parasites draining the life and meaning out of an otherwise useful article.  See, for example, something like Roe v. Wade  there's no need to use that article to debate all the pros and cons of the subject involved  there are other articles for that linked at the bottom  just state the facts about the case.  Even if you really consider Moore's movie to be completely indefinsible propaganda (and to risk the Wiki-equivalent of Godwin's Law here), note that the article on Triumph of the Will doesn't feel the need to explain all the reasons why Nazi Germany wasn't all it was cracked up to be.   Similarly, shouldn't we just describe the content of the movie (noting that it is controversial), and then if we want an article about the Bin Laden family departure or whatever we can put the facts about that subject there?   20:19, 5 Jul 2004 (UTC)",0,0,0,0,0,0,False
