 Sorry for being so annoying, I have another question!  The first line of the article states that this is """"a gridless inertial electrostatic confinement fusion process"""".  Now, the last 2 paragraphs I wrote were in reference to the magnetic mirror (wanting more information), but I also want to pick about the """"inertial electrostatic confinement"""" part.  Is this really inertial?  For that to be the case, shouldn't you be throwing fuel into the reactor as it fusions to have it accelerated by the electric field created by the negative charges?  My impressions up to this point was that this is not the case.  Take a Tokomak for instance, there is much more fuel present than what is fissioning at any given time.  It just bounces around until two particles """"hit"""".  Is that not the case with the polywell?  If you say """"inertial"""", you are suggesting the opposite, that fuel ions are accelerated and fissioned in a continuous stream injected into the core.

 == British Meaning? == 

  
 Sorry if this has already been covered here, but it seems to me like the """"British meanings"""" section needs to be removed from the article. 
 It has nothing to do with americanizing wikipedia, or anything like that. It's just that this is specifically an article about using 'faggot' as an insult. And while although 'fag' is an entirely valid word for a cigarette, I can't imagine how it could be used as both a cigarette and an insult in the same sentence. 
 I hope I'm making myself clear here; I might be rambling. The disambiguation page for 'fag' (rightly) includes the link to cigarettes. But the article specifically for the insult really shouldn't. (or, at the very least, shouldn't have an entire section on meat and cigarettes)   

 No  1) it's relevant for the origins of the epithet, if only to rule out some popular misconceptions  - there used to a load of fanciful nonsense on this. 2) the article needs to define the limits of the epithet by covering different meanings    

 :1) No, the etymology section is relevant for the origins of the epithet. 2) Cigarette is not a meaning of specifically the insult. See the difference? Cigarette is a meaning of 'fag'. Cigarette is not a way of interpreting 'faggot' if you first specifically clarify that you intend it as an insult.   

 See section below - this article attracts so much nonsense that it is best to stake out the whole linguistic area in an accurate fashion, otherwise you will have (as we have had in the past) that the Uk cigarette meaning comes from burning gays (although using them to light witches is new).    

 ==Homosexuals doused in fuel and burned?== 

 homosexuals were supposedly burnt at the stake in medieval England. More accurately, they were doused in fuel and used in place of sticks for the burning of supposed witches. Surely that can't be right??? They might indeed have been burnt at the stake as heretics, but used as mere kindling to burn witches?  
 :Yes, I find this very odd as well.  Now most sources I've read certainly indicate that burning has never been the normal punishment for homosexuals in Britain.  And burning homosexuals as heretics is not the same as burning them for homosexuality — particularly as that was made a crime in itself.  Has anyone read this Homophobia book?  How well-researched does this item appear?  Either way, the burning-at-the-stake story is highly unlikely to have much to do with the modern offensive use of the word.   

 This is absolute nonsense. It's a myth, one, and the word didn't mean """"homosexual"""" when people were burnt at the stake, two. Just because some guy repeated it in a book doesn't mean we have to.   

 == Faggot to fag == 

  
 Although this is """"original research"""", after learning the original meaning of faggot, the first connection I made was that gay men are people who put their """"sticks"""" together. also Is there any chance that this is a source for the word?

 Hi Ed, noticed your revert, and was about to revert again, but checked your profile just to make sure we weren't going to have a revert """"war"""". Looks like a quick chat might be better.  

 I was just curious to why you were adding 250px tags to images like the one on the Tidal Barrage page. 

 Wikipedia isn't a fixed width site, so adding width tags, especially to thumbnail images doesn't work the same as it would for a fixed-width size like CNN.com or BBC News. 

 On top of that, as a registered user you can control the default widths for thumbnail images in your preferences control panel. 

 An an unregistered user, the default is already 250px. 

 If you want examples check out River Thames or Microsoft and search in the Wikicode for Image: - note their are no sizes for any images. The only exceptions are panoramas which are much wider than standard thumbnail images.

 前文  
 　 冬休みが終わり、李さんと王さんは久しぶりに会いました。  
 　 今日は暇なので、李さんは王さんを誘って留学生の山崎さんを訪ねました。山崎さんはとても親切な人で、友達が来る時には、いつも部屋をきれいに掃除しておいたり、お菓子を買ってきておいたりします。彼の部屋は広く、棚の上には家族の写真が飾ってあり、サイドボードの中には、誕生日に友達からもらったグラスが置いてあります。壁には、地理の勉強のための中国地図が貼ってあります。  
 　 久しぶりに会ったので、三人は楽しく食事をしました。李さんは手が滑って、コップを一つ割ってしまいましたが、さいわい、けがはしませんでした。  
 会話  
 王　：李さん、お久しぶりですね。お元気ですか。  
 李　：ええ、おかげさまで元気です。王さんは。  
 王　：私も元気です。冬休みはどうでしたか。  
 李　：ええ、とても楽しかったですよ。明日、新学期が始まりますから、また忙しくなりますね。  
 王　：そうですね。李さんは新学期の準備をしましたか。  
 李　：ええ、教科書の学習内容を少し予習しておきました。  
 王　：それはいいですね。学部では明日会議があるようです。  
 李　：そうですか。どんな準備がしてありますか。  
 王　：学部の入口には告知板が立ててあります。会議室には椅子がたくさん並べてあります。そして壇の上には大きな机が置いてありますよ。  
 李　：そうですか。どころで、王さん、今日はお暇ですか。  
 王　：はい、今日は何もすることがありませんけど。  
 李　：それでは山崎さんのところへ遊びに行ってみませんか。  
 王　：いいですね。遊びに行ってみましょう。山崎さんは留学生寮の何号館に住んでいるか知っていますか。  
 李　：ええ、はっきり覚えていませんけれど、行けばすぐわかると思います。  
 王　：部屋は何号室だか覚えていますか。  
 李　：部屋の番号も忘れてしまいました。  
 王　：やはり電話をかけて聞いておいた方がいいですね。  
 李　：そうですね。電話をかけて聞いておきましょう。  
 （留学生寮で）  
 王　：李さん、この部屋が山崎さんの部屋のようです。  
 李　：ドアに何と書いてありますか。  
 王　：ドアに山崎文雄と書いてあります。  
 李　：ごめんください。少しも聞こえないようですね。  
 王　：ノックをしてみましょう。（トン　トン　トン）  
 山崎：どなたですか。  
 李　：李と王です。  
 山崎：やあ、李さん、王さん、いらっしゃい。どうぞお入りください。  
 李　：お邪魔します。靴をはいたまま入ってもいいですか。  
 山崎：はい、かまいません。  
 王　：明るくていい部屋ですね。  
 李　：しかも、きれいに掃除してありますね。  
 山崎：今日は特に丁寧に掃除したんです。ふだんはそれほど丁寧にしません。  
 李　：それはどうも恐れ入ります。友達が来る時はいつもこう片付けるのですか。  
 山崎：ええ、いつも掃除をしておきます。テーブルの上に花を飾っておきます。また、お湯を沸かしておいたり、お菓子を買ってきておいたりします。  
 李　：そうですか。棚の上に飾ってある写真は何ですか。  
 山崎：あれは私の家族の写真です。  
 王　：サイドボードの中に置いてあるグラスは中国の物ですか。  
 山崎：はい、誕生日に友達からもらったものです。  
 李　：壁に貼ってあるのは中国地図ですね。  
 山崎：ええ、中国の地理を勉強するために貼ったんです。  
 王　：本棚に並べてある本は何ですか。  
 山崎：どれですか。  
 王　：あれです。  
 山崎：ああ、あれですか。あれは日本語版の中国古典小説です。  
 李　：そうですか。このごろ、中国の小説を読んでいるんですか。  
 山崎：はい、「三国志」を毎日少しずつ読んでいます。  
 李　：もう読んでしまいましたか。  
 山崎：いや、この小説は長いですよ。それにちょっと名前が難しいですね。読んでいると、だれがだれだか分からなくなります。  
 王　：私はいい方法を知っていますよ。小説に出てくる人の名前を書いておいて、だれがだれだか、チェックしながら読むんです。そうすれば、きっとよく分かるようになります。  
 山崎：それはいい考えですね。私もやってみましょう。では、そろそろ時間ですから食事の用意をしましょう。  
 李　：はい、どうしますか。  
 山崎：椅子を並べておいてください。それからお皿やコップ、おはしを並べておいてください。  
 李　：あっ、すみません。  
 山崎：どうしました？  
 李　：コップを割ってしまいました。  
 山崎：どうしたんですか。  
 李　：手が滑ってしまったんです。  
 山崎：手はけがしませんでしたか。  
 李　：大丈夫です。ご心配なく。  
 山崎：じゃあ、一緒に楽しく食事をしましょう。  
 李　：テレビをつけたままでよろしいですか。  
 山崎：はい、そのあとすぐニュース番組ですから、しばらくそのままにしておいてください。

 课程讲解 
 一、动词ておく  
 书上写的是“动词准备体由动词连用形后续“ておく”构成。”赋予ておく以动词准备体的语法成分。不过我不是很支持大家去背这些是什么体，什么体，日语里面这些体的数量足以让大家头晕了。书上这么写是出于语法研究的目的，以表现得正规。但是我们必须得明白，在考试的时候，不可能出填空题“问：某某某是_____体”的，和日本人交流，也不可能被他们问，这是什么语法成分。所以！我们只需要明白这几个假名表示的是什么意思即可。  
 那么，我们就来看在使用动词ておく的时候，究竟可以表达出什么样的含义呢？  
 1、为了准备某种目的而事先做好准备工作。  
 来看个例句先：  
 e.g：昼ご飯といっしょに晩ご飯を作っていおいて、仕事に出かけました。  
 做午饭的时候把晚饭也一起作了，然后才去上班。  
 在这里我们可以明显的看到，作っていおいて表达出了处于可能是由于晚饭来不及作等原因，而事先做好了晚饭这个动作（作っていおいて是作っておく的接续形式，表示的是和后面出去上班的动作先后顺序）。  

 2、表示让某种状态继续保持下来。  
 e.g：これは記念に残しておいてください。  
 请把这个作为纪念（品）留下来吧。  
 这里就表达出了把保留这个动作一直持续地作下去的意思。  

 说老实话，这个用法对于非专业人士来说，要灵活的运用并不是件容易的事情。可能只有在日后更多的使用中来掌握了。  

 二、动词てある  
 书上赋役了这个用法“动词存续体”的语法含义。很不幸的，该用法在这课里面和前面的ておく一起出现，而且含义十分接近，这就直接导致了很多人弄混淆这两个用法。  
 我们来看てある的用法吧。  

 这也可以表示两种用法（-_-#）  
 1、表示某事物保持某人动作的结果所造成的状态。  
 e.g：テーブルに食器が並べてあります。  
 桌子上摆着餐具。  
 表达桌子上一直保持这有餐具这个状态。  

 2、表示事先做好了某事。（和ておく一比，该晕了吧？）  
 e.g：約束はしてありますか。  
 事先约好了吧？  

 在我学习这一课的时候，这两个语法也困扰了我很久，在很大的程度上也打击了我以后对日语学习的激情。第一册期末考试的时候，我还考了94分，全班第四，但是此后就每况愈下，沦落到70多了……唉。扯回正题，てある和てお",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

d7a0ba6fd212e1e2,"== Etymology == 

 The 'History' section says  

 The word Antimony is a Latin corruption of Arabic انتيمون ([al-]ithmīd), which is derived from Latin Stibium, which came from Greek στιβι [stibi] = a cosmetic powder (Sb2S3 was used for cosmetic purposes). The relationship between antimony's modern name and its symbol is complex; the Coptic name for the cosmetic powder antimony sulfide was borrowed by the Greeks, which was in turn borrowed by Latin, resulting in stibium. 

 I have three comments on this.  
 # The Arabic quoted says 'Antimun' not 'al-ithmid'. I can edit it, but I think there are bigger issues 
 # This derivation is given in the original Oxford English Dictionary as doubly speculative - both 'antimony' from 'al-uthmud' and 'ithmid' from Greek 'stimmid' are there hedged about with 'possibly' and 'suggestion'. Unless somebody has some more recent, authoritative support for the etymology, it should be shown as speculative.

 PS- I have posted the following on discussion page of article bihar: 
 quoteThe edits of 17 April 2005 by Hottentot has been reverted by me as already there was a section in the article Bihar – Bihar (disambiguation) and as such there was no justifiable reason to change the main character by the name Bihar. The edits regarding Bihar by Hottentot are being placed in the section Bihar (disambiguation) . Here, it is also pertinent to note that though wikipedia sets its own standard, but even in Enclopaedia Britannica Bihar has been separately dealt with, and in my humble opinion the case with wikipedia should not be different. The article Bihar represents a state of India and 100 million people reside in Bihar and Bihar has a recorded history of 2500 years. In any case, the position of Bihar as a separate article  was already accepted by the community of wikipedians as the legend Bihar (disambiguation) was there along with the main article of Bihar. 

 I trust that the position has been clarified.Unquote

 :This review is transcluded from Talk:Yoko Ono/GA1. The edit link for this section can be used to add comments to the review. 

 Reviewer:   ·   

  
 I read through this article a few weeks back, so I'm in a handy position to GA review it. I think this is a tough candidate for GA - do you write about Yoko Ono the highly original and strong willed artist who was ahead of her time, Yoko Ono the morally supportive wife and advocate for world peace, or Yoko Ono the funny woman who put weird noises on Beatles records and caused them to break up? 

 I can see immediate problems with large amounts of completely unsourced text, such as the second and third paragraphs in """"Early life and family"""", where her experiences during and immediately after WWII are especially problematic and must be backed up properly. The quote about """"Hide and seek"""" also requires a citation, which must be either a copy of Grapefruit or a good impartial review of it. 

 I also notice some of the citations don't appear to link through correctly, for example I see a reference to """"Miles 1997"""", which I recognise as Barry Miles' official biography of Paul McCartney. I think these issues will need to be resolved in order to stand a good chance of the review passing, I'm afraid. 

 I notice the article has previously been through a Good Article Reassessment. Have you covered all the issues raised there?

Since the denaturing and annealing processes still continue without primers, the single-stranded DNA molecules reanneal to themselves.

 == Your explanation, as requested == 

  
 I revised the previous version a bit to cater it more to your liking. I fail to see what needs explaining, but I will now dissect each statement in the opening paragraph. 

 """"Rachel Aliene Corrie (April 10, 1979 – March 16, 2003) was an American member of the International Solidarity Movement (ISM)."""" Explanation: She was a member of the International Solidarity Movement. 

 """"She died while acting as a human shield during the demolition of a Palestinian home in Gaza."""" Explanation: She died while acting as a human shield during the demolition of a Palestinian home in Gaza. You may watch the multiple award winning documentary Occupation 101 to verify this. Something tells me that you are going to argue whether or not the documentary is a reliable source. So let me preemptively respond. The documentary won 2 awards at the Beverly Hills Film Festival, another award at the Artist Film Festival, another at the East Lansing Film Festival, another at the Deadcenter Film Festival, and yet another at the New Orleans Film Festival. Not only that, but the documentary features numerous interviews with scholars, religious leaders, humanitarian workers, and NGO representatives from your rightful homeland, Israel. 

 """"Witnesses state that she was caught underneath a bulldozer, while the IDF investigation reported that she died after being struck by falling debris."""" Explanation: Witnesses stated that she got caught underneath a bulldozer. Yet again, you may refer to Occupation 101 to see real-time footage of witnesses testifying to that. And as you know, the IDF investigation reported that she died after being struck by falling debris. 

 """"Furthermore, while the investigation reported that the driver of the bulldozer could not see her, witnesses maintain that there was nothing to obscure the driver's view."""" Explanation: The investigation reported that the driver of the armored bulldozer could not see her. Witnesses maintained that there was nothing to obscure the driver's view. Obviously, there are disputes on this, and we are never going to know the truth, but it would be an insult to her memory to only include one perspective in the introduction. 

 """"At the time of her death, Corrie was a student at the Evergreen State College in Washington."""" Explanation: She was indeed a student at Evergreen. Once again I am going to assume that you will insist that we include that she was there at the time of the Second Intifada, presumably to make it clear that she knowingly entered a war zone, and by extension, that she was at least in part (or perhaps fully, as some would have it) responsible for her own death.

 Why is this listed as a Punic war?  While it occured between the first and second it is not actually a Punic War.  The Punic Wars were all between Rome and Carthage.   

 :It isn't exactly part of the Punic wars, but it is related to them. It was triggered as a  result of the after-effects of the First Punic war, and the after-effects of the Mercenary War triggered another conflict between Rome and Carthage (very small and brief), which exaggerated the impact of the post-war indemnity that Rome demanded of Carthage. It can be argued that it was the oppressive conditions of the treaties and the resentment by Carthage/Hannibal Barca that lead to the Second Punic War - so it did involve the Rome-Carthage conflicts indirectly. 

 :It also was the event that elevated the Barcid family in Carthaginian society because of Hamilcar's generalship in the war. It could be argued that without this boost to the """"family fortunes"""" that Hannibal Barca would not have been in a position to trigger the Second Punic war. 

 :So, is it part of the Punic wars? Maybe; maybe not. Is it related to the Punic wars? Absolutely - without the Punic wars it wouldn't have occurred, and - arguably - without it the second Punic war might not have occurred, or would at least have been very different. -  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

 Have we become a nation of crybabies? 

 AS a powerless, weak and mute citizen of this country, which has suffered unabated terrorism for the past 15 years, I think the least we all can do now is to profusely thank our Home Minister for enlightening us about the terrorist attacks. We have repeatedly been educated that the terrorists are from Pakistan or from organisations aided by Pakistan. Not only have we been updated on the tactics adopted by the terrorists, but we have also been educated about their motives and also the why of their attacks. We did not know that attacks on places of worship can spark off communal riots. 

 Our grateful thanks to you... a million thanks, indeed! We feel humble and obliged for the extraordinary revelations you so frequently take the pains to make from the precincts of Parliament or from the scene of the latest attacks you choose to visit and explain all over again the why of the attacks to the """"unaware and ignorant population"""" there! Indeed we had never been so lucky as to get such lessons in the past. We really feel we are so dumb and oblivious of what goes on in the country! 

 Perhaps the Home Minister may take a little more time to tell us about the lessons we have so far learnt from our history which tells us how we as a nation have always received thrashing at the hands of foreigners... starting from the Alexanders, Kushaks, Huns, Khiljis, Tuglaks, Gaznavis, Mohammad Ghauris, Changez Khans, the Mughals, the Britishers and finally our own people who, after attaining power, have systematically looted and plundered us.  
 
   
          
 

  

 

   History forces us to conclude that perhaps we are a nation of cowards. To hide the facts, we have repeatedly sung songs about our secularism, tolerance, universal brotherhood, harmony, Ahimsa and have never been tired of saying this! Perhaps, our learned Home Minister may also enlighten us about the myth of reverence and respect for the fair gender that has so graphically been depicted in cases of Shakuntalas, Sitas, Draupadis, Ahillyas, scores of women made to sit on the funeral pyres of their husbands and now Roop Kanwars, Shivanis, Shalinis and Shah Banos!  

 Then there is the latest case of a political figure in lawless Bihar abducting a married woman, having a four years child, and forcing her to marry him in full public knowledge. Perhaps, in his wisdom, he can also educate us about the real reasons for the women reservation Bill not seeing the light of the day despite open acceptance for the need to have it! 

 We seem to have become a nation of crybabies, seeking sympathy from those who do not care for us. We are tiring ourselves into disgraceful submission to the writ of the terrorists. We are amazed at the outbursts of the self-appointed spokespersons of the Hindu and Muslim fundamental outfits, pouring venom and instigating cries against each other just because they can get away with it, thanks to the near absence of the rule of law in the country. Where were they till 1947 when we were under the subjugation of a no-nonsense foreign government? 

 Thank you, once again, our learned Home Minister, for keeping us awake. Keep it up and keep it going!

 Is it true? 

 A well-known Pakistani weekly Friday Times (Oct 4-10, 2002, comment page) published the following piece under the heading “Pir Karam Shah was Lawrence of Arabia”. 

 “According to Khabrain magazine, one Pir Karam Shah active in India in 1927 was actually T.E. Lawrence or Lawrence of Arabia sent to India on a secret mission. He lived for two years in NWFP. He was sent again in 1935 to operate in a number of places in India. He was a graduate of Al Azhar and knew his Arabic. This was the year when the British government told the world that Lawrence had died in an accident in England. In Srinagar, Lawrence started giving sermons in the Hazratbal mosque as Pir Karam Shah. There, a new convert to Islam (after falling in love with a Muslim Gujjar woman), Henry Nedou fell under his charm in a mosque and married his daughter to him. This Nedou was the owner of the Nedous Hotel where the Avari Hotel of today is standing in Lahore. Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanvi of Deoband was privy to the secret identity of Lawrence and warned his Deobandi disciples not to fall prey to Lawrence’s expertise in Islamic fiqht. One disciple had actually become the follower of Lawrence as Pir Karam Shah. 

 He exposed him by provoking him. He said Shakespeare was actually an Iranian Pir called Sheikh Pir. On this, Pir Karam Shah lost his temper and started haranguing him in E",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

 Hi MalleusMaleficarum1486, after seeing what  wrote and your follow-up comments, I am writing regarding the Wikipedia WP:CIVILITY pillar in my capacity as an administrator on Wikipedia.  The essence of civility is maintaining respect for the people you're interacting with on Wikipedia, even if you disagree with their views.  This can be tough to do, believe me I know, especially if you really don't respect their views:  it's easy to think, 'You hold an idiotic view therefore you must be an idiot too.'   

 I also know that on Wikipedia it's easy to get away with hurling insults in someone's direction by insulting their actions or views instead of the person.  You can't say 'You're an idiot and a jerk' but saying 'You write idiotic things a jerk would write' gets you through an WP:NPA loophole.  However doing that doesn't meet with the core civility principle of maintaining respect, so please don't do it.  If you do it, whatever message you were trying to get across will be totally lost, and if your goal was really to try to convince someone of something, you will have failed. 

 Please contact me on my User Talk if you have any questions.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False
