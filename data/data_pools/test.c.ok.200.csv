 Reviewer:   ·   

  

 I'm on much more familiar ground with this article than with the last of your GANs I tangled with. I wrote much of the two WP articles on Elizabeth David and her books, so you can set me down as another foodie. I blew the dust off Mrs David's Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen, and can tell you, if you'd prefer to add a page reference instead of the link at ref 17, that ED's mention of Lady Clark's Thick Parmesan Biscuits is on pp. 230–31 of my copy (the Grub Street 2000 reissue, ISBN 9781902304663). 
 Some comments: 
 *Lead 
 **""""Lady Charlotte Clark"""" – dear me, you'll upset those strange but harmless souls who sleep with Debrett under their pillows (I nearly wrote that they slept with Burke's): you mustn't call her Lady Charlotte unless she was the daughter of an earl or even posher nobleman. As her father was a commoner, she was Charlotte, Lady Clark. 
 **""""the cook Elizabeth David"""" – she was a cook, of course, but """"cookery writer"""" as you describe her later in the text seems a better description. 
 *Context 
 **""""You tell us practically nothing of the Clarks. There is a Times obituary of Sir John, dated 14 April 1910 (which I can send you if you haven't got online access to The Timess archives) which tells you more than enough for your present article. 
 **""""They lived for some years in Turin"""" – the last person named was Henry James, and I think you should write """"The Clarks lived…"""" here to avoid ambiguity. 
 **Blockquote – the parenthentic dashes should be either unspaced em-dashes or spaced en-dashes, and not hyphens. 
 *Book 
 **I don't for a moment suggest that you must do it, but have you considered putting the list of contents into two or possibly even three columns? Easier on your reader's eye, I find. 
 *Approach 
 **""""'Zucchetti à la Piedmontaise.'"""""""" – there is an extra set of closing quotes here 
 *Modern 
 **""""an inspiration for, the great Elizabeth David"""" – WP:OVERLINK at this point 
 **""""well-travelled diplomats wife"""" – I see you have faithfully transcribed the original, in which there is no possessive apostrophe. I'm not sure what to suggest here. It's too minor a matter for a [sic]; I think the MoS gives you licence to add the missing apostrophe silently. You may like to consider. 
 **In the first Holt blockquote, the quotation marks should be doubles, not singles. In the second there are more hyphens that need replacing with dashes 
 **Last blockquote – more quotation marks that should be doubles, not singles 
 *Notes 
 **""""Courgettes or Zucchini"""" – capitalisation really wanted here? 
 *References 
 **There are several mentions of """"Frere (1909)"""" but no bibliographical details of the work in the refs/citations section. They are included earlier, within the main text, but I think they should be repeated here with the refs. You should add OCLC numbers for both editions there, too: WorldCat will oblige. 
 **The links to the Find My Past site should include the {{subscription}} template 
 **You might standardise on either """"page"""" or """"p."""" in your book refs. Compare, e.g. refs 13 and 14. 
 **To my mind the bibliographical info for ref 14 should include the ISBN (or OCLC if for some reason there isn't an ISBN) 
 **Page ranges (ref 6) and date ranges (ref 14) should have an unspaced en-dash rather than a hyphen, and I should say the hyphen in ref 7 ought to be a spaced en-dash. 
 **Ref 15 – page number lacking (I can get this from the British Library after Christmas if it's a problem) 
 **Ref 16 – The Spectator should be italicised, as the TLS is in the previous ref. 
 Most of these are easy fixes, but I really would like the biography to be addressed, given that suitable sources are available. – '  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

 OK, I just don't want more unsourced crap to sort through later.  This article is already shoddy, poorly-written, poorly-organized, and poorly-sourced.  Why don't we try fixing it instead of adding more poorly-source, poorly-written, and poorly-organized crap?  Ports don't deserve their own section.  Ports belong in a development section. Granted, this article doesn't have such a section, but why don't we try making one instead of contributing more spam? Also, for that matter, what makes ports noteworthy? If it's a port released a decade later with new features as a tenth-anniversary edition or something (Tomb Raider: Anniversary, Resident Evil: Deadly Silence), then I can see why we would add information.

 ==Arbitration enforcement action appeal by Protonk== 

 Procedural notes: The rules governing arbitration enforcement appeals are found here. According to the procedures, a """"clear, substantial, and active consensus of uninvolved editors"""" is required to overturn an arbitration enforcement action. To help determine any such consensus, involved editors may make brief statements in separate sections but should not edit the section for discussion among uninvolved editors. Editors are normally considered involved if they are in a current dispute with the sanctioning or sanctioned editor, or have taken part in disputes (if any) related to the contested enforcement action. Administrators having taken administrative actions are not normally considered involved for this reason alone (see WP:UNINVOLVED). 

 ; Appealing user   –    

 ; Sanction being appealed  24 hour block and 3 month topic ban pursuant to GG sanctions, logged here 

 ; Administrator imposing the sanction   

 ; Notification of that administrator  The appealing editor is asked to notify the administrator who made the enforcement action of this appeal, and then to replace this text with a diff of that notification. The appeal may not be processed otherwise. If a block is appealed, the editor moving the appeal to this board should make the notification. 

 ===Statement by Protonk=== 

 Please bear with me through a somewhat indirect appeal, as the justification for my block is so Kafkaesque I cannot diagram the single sentence which provoked it to defend my actions without inviting further sanction. 
    
 I was blocked under the GG discretionary sanctions for this edit (admins can review the diff). The justification was (near as I can tell) """"advocat[ing] ignoring policy"""" and """"repeat[ing] an egregious BLP violation"""" (diff) while doing so.  

 The statement that I made is unambiguously true, sourced to multiple reliable sources in the gamergate article, and central to the dispute at hand. Further, the only way to read defamation or denigration from that sentence is to rip words out from the incredibly limited context I provided. I'm not even making the half-assed claim that you have to read that sentence in light of my entire oeuvre or even a whole paragraph in order to gain contextyou just have to read the entire sentence. Like I said above, I can't diagram said sentence here, so forgive me an analogy. 

 We have on Wikipedia an entire article devoted to a scurrilous accusation, one which is obviously provably false. An accusation which not only violates BLP it caused the BLP policy to come into being. In it we state """"The article falsely stated that Seigenthaler had been a suspect in the assassinations of U.S. President John F. Kennedy and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy."""" We recognize that the embedded statement """"...Seigenthaler had been a suspect in the assassinations..."""" is a BLP violation. It's a false, unsourced claim about a living person. The encompassing sentence is not a BLP violation because it is a true, sourced claim. It cannot be one regardless of the awfulness of the original claim. There is no transitive property of BLP.  

 Further, the same basic idea is already present in our current article: """"Shortly after the release of Depression Quest on Steam in August 2014, Quinn's former boyfriend Eron Gjoni wrote a blog post, described by The New York Times as a """"rambling online essay"""", containing a series of allegations, among which was that Quinn had an affair with Kotaku journalist Nathan Grayson."""" Snipping out the meandering clauses we get """"...Quinn's former boyfriend Eron Gjoni wrote a blog post...[alleging]...Quinn had an affair with Kotaku journalist Nathan Grayson."""" I'm really struggling here to see the substantive difference between that and what I wrote. If the distinction was that I didn't cite my source, a 3 month topic ban seems a bit harsh. 

 As for the charge of advocating ignoring policy: fuck that.  The interpretation of BLP which I decried in that edit is perverse and nonsensical (see this redaction for a good example, paying close attention to what was and wasn't retracted). If our policy is arbitrary enough that an admin (admittedly one who is pretty intemperate and not very smart) can get topic banned for three months over a single edit for content that is already in a wikipedia article then I have absolutely no regrets in advocating we ignore it.

bda1009911d0e836,"== removal of my page == 

 I have noticed that my page has already been deleted and before I had a chance to respond.  That is not fair.  I thought I had seven days, obviously something is wrong. 

 I have read all the comments.  Here is my response 

 1. 	 I admit I am a newbie and perhaps I didn’t follow proper procedures.  I find the instructions on Wikipedia written for computer nerds, but not for the average person like me.  So I am doing my best to understand and anyone who has valid concerns, I am willing to read and respond accordingly. 

 2. 	 That said.  Let me make some preliminary remarks first.  I do not know any of the people who are making these concerns.  I don’t  know if you are gay or straight.  Whether you are a leader in gay rights movement or whether you were a large contributor to the Prop 8 campaign.  I don’t know whether you are saying “nay” because you honestly do not feel my achievements are not worthy or whether you have a bias against gays and don’t want Wikipedia to show anything which would put gays in positive light. 

 One of the people who responded was a minister (I don’t see his comments now for some reason).  Now I know that there are many denominations which are supportive of the gay community such as Quakers, Unitarians, United Church of Christ, Metropolitan Community Churches and Reform Jews.  But there are many denominations which have caused a lot of pain to the gay community such as Mormons, Southern Baptists, and Assembly of God.  So I don’t know where you are coming from. 

 I do not mind making some editing changes, but I do not want to be removed because of homophobes who has a bias against gays. 

 So let’s take a look at some of the concerns. 

 1. 	 Polly said that I said I was the first gay school board member and she didn’t think that was correct.  She is right.  It isn’t correct, because that is not what I said.  I am the first gay person in the country to win a seat on an elementary school board.  I was also the very first gay person to be elected to a school board below college level in California.   

 Someone said where is the verification.  I am not sure what verification you need, however you can verify what I said from a book called Out for Office which was published by the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund. 

 If there other things that you need to be verified let me know and I will provide that. 

 Someone said that being the first gay school board member, why is that so significant?  Please refer to the Wikipedia page for Harvey Milk.  He served in office less than a year before he was killed by a homophobe.  He was elected to the city council of that city.  As the Wikipedia page says he was elected as the first gay man in California.  I have served on a school board for over 20 years.  Are you saying that a gay person who served less than a year is more important than a gay person who has served for over 20? 

 So how can I appeal the decision to have me removed?  Please respond to rosevillegarymiller@yahoo.com",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

 = Juan de Borja y Arnau == 
 Good afternoon. 

 I just have read your messag and seen your back changes of my edition. You´re asking me why. I´m answering with pleasure. Some tiem I was writing the article Juan de Borja y Arnau (I must to say I´m an historical and genealogical investigator and I´m writing a bokk about theme) because I find reading and revising all documents that juan de Borja y Arnau was the real person in contraposition of Juan de Borja y Armendía. The second surname of Don Juan de Borja was changed as consecuence a crime commited by Borjas in Ecuador against Spanish Crown. This Borjas wanted the Dukedom of Gandia but they can´t obtained. After that they build the page Juan de Borja y Armendia making them jus only descendants of him because convinience. .... I wrote the real pagge about Don Juande Borja y Arnau President of Royal Audience of Santa Fe. Consecuently I have been attacked by the borja´s family in Ecuador and the Grimaldi´s Family which has many interest i the theme because Dukedom of Valentinois and other just like Camerino. Juan de borja y Arnau is the true inheritance and he had many descendants in South America but this descendants is denied by Borja´s Family in Ecuador and Grimaldi´s Family in Europe. They had attacked the page in all languages; in consecuence, I erased them because I don´t want troubles. ... This has teaching me one thing, Wikipedia is not free enciclopeic project; second, More than half of wikipedia is a total falsehood because wrotes had been wrotes under conviniences and Libraries are taking part of this. .... I must to clear I put all verificable references and bibliography; biblography that is serious and responsible and are documents of historians whose knew to Juan de Borja y Arnau and other from serious writers. .... On the other hand, page from Juan de Borja y Armendia has no a real biblography; just that they consider convinience. .....  

 As legitime descendant of Don Jaun de Borja president of Rotyal Audience of Santa Fe (New Granada-Colombia),  and legitime heir of him, I decided to write a real and true page about him supported with total documents but librarians and wikipedians just argument had give me for erase them have been """"I can´t put in doubt a page from once years ago"""", no more, no least, and as all of them (all librarians) had attack me; I took decision to erase the pages by myself because I build them. I don´t need troubles with no one, I don´t need stupid discusions with ignorant and gneciscience people. .... I´m doing a mayor project and I have no time for fools (not you of course). 

 Consecuently, I ask you a please. I shall erase once more the page about Juan de Borja y Arnau. The Spanish Royal Crown just has the documents or soon will have. So that, please, I´ll erase pages and please don´t revert my eraser. Wikipedia is a simple copy-paste; no more, no least.

 - 
 I read this to mean that the mass movements were trying to win the release of people convicted of murderers; or """"alleged murderers"""".  It could be worded better.  The declaration in the 70s is rather like a presidential pardon.  It doesn't erase the fact that a crime was committed, it simply removes the guilt of that crime.   

 """"The case is still officially open""""?  Governor Dukakis' proclamation, by its terms, does not address the question of guilt or innocence, thus, at least implicitly, leaving the conviction undisturbed.  And they were both executed.  The case seems closed to me.  To state the case is still open suggests that someone is still looking for the murderer(s).  Is that true?
